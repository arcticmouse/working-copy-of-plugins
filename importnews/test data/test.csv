But UNT Health Science Center helps them get to the heart of the matter with Camp Cardiac.</p><p>This summer, 22 students participated in a full week of education about the medical profession centered on the cardiovascular system.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Camp Cardiac gives us experiences we wouldn&rsquo;t have in a normal high school setting, such as pig-heart dissections and sutures. It shows us what med school would be like and the basics of what is expected from a doctor,&rdquo; said Ashley Watson, a student at Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas.</p><p>&ldquo;After this camp, I will definitely be going into the medical field, specifically in the cardio-thoracic area,&rdquo; said Grace Kamau, a student at Heritage High School in Frisco.</p><p>&nbsp;And it was all made possible by students in UNTHSC&rsquo;s Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine. Camp Cardiac is a national project of Doctor Development NFP. The camps are held in several locations across the U.S. Because of the efforts of TCOM students, UNTHSC hosted a camp for the first time this year.</p><p>First-year TCOM students applied to Doctor Development, were accepted and then developed the curriculum and organized the week&rsquo;s activities, scheduling rooms, recruiting faculty members and managing dozens of details.</p><p>&ldquo;We've met students from multiple medical schools across the country, and although they all have compassion for helping others, occasionally a group of students stands out above the rest.&nbsp; UNTHSC is clearly one of those institutions,&rdquo; said Michael Yensel, President of Doctor Development.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious that UNTHSC promotes a culture of service.&nbsp; We were overwhelmed by the maturity and altruism of each and every medical student with whom we interacted on the campus,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are extremely grateful and proud to be associated with incredible humanitarians such as those at UNT Health Science Center.&rdquo; </p>","Education, community",Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine,,"Camp Cardio, TCOM, students, outreach",Photo1465,7/17/14 0:00,High school students experience real-world learning,"<img src=""http://www.hsc.unt.edu/news/upload/TABS%202014%20(2).jpg"" alt="""" align=""right"" /> High school students experience real-world learning<br /><br />Freshman high school students from the Texas Academy of Biomedical Sciences earned white coats recently in a ceremony culminating their week-long learning experience on the UNT Health Science Center campus.<br /><br />TABS students can earn dual credit as they prepare for higher education in the health sciences.

The itching kept him awake at night. Even his day care teachers were concerned.</p>  <p>&quot;He was miserable and itchy,&quot; Brandy Green said. &quot;And that was hard on all of us, especially since no one was getting any sleep.&quot;</p>  <p>The Greenes took Jaylen to a dermatologist, but the medications the doctor recommended didn't work. So Brandy Greene, senior auditor with UNT System, made an appointment for Jaylen to see Stuart Brown, MD, and Ryan Pham, DO, a dermatology resident at UNT Health Science Center. </p>  <p>Dr. Brown, who has several decades of experience in dermatology, oversees the UNTHSC Dermatology Division's resident doctor program. He recognized Jaylen's skin condition as a serious case of eczema - a common ailment that caused Jayden's face to turn dry and crusty. </p>  <p>Dr. Brown ordered up a prescription ointment and suggested ways the Greenes could moisturize Jaylen's skin. Jaylen's rash disappeared almost instantaneously. The itching stopped. He slept again.</p>  <p>Not only did Dr. Brown treat Jaylen's eczema, Brandy Greene said, but he diagnosed another skin abnormality in Jaylen -a small, harmless indention in his thigh where his skin did not fuse properly. </p>  <p>Several doctors were previously unable to identify the indention, so it was a relief to learn that it was nothing to worry about, Brandy Greene said.</p>  <p>Now that Jaylen's rash is gone, he is a happy baby again, Brandy Greene said.</p>  <p>&quot;Other parents at day care keep asking us what dermatologist we saw because Jaylen's skin looks so much better,&quot; she said. &quot;We were so happy with our experience at UNT Health.&quot;</p>",Patient Care,Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine,Dermatology,faculty,Photo1462,7/11/14 0:00,Taking the time to listen builds patient's trust and loyalty,"<img src=""../../news/upload/Jim-Pythress-with-care-team.jpg"" alt=""Jim Poythress with UNTHSC care team"" title=""Jim Poythress with UNTHSC care team"" /> <p>One weekend last March, Jim Poythress experienced chest pains and clammy skin.</p>  <p>Poythress, 76, who suffers from coronary artery disease, immediately contacted Nurse Practitioner Nancy Tierney, PhD, and sped to the emergency room. </p>  <p>The next morning, cardiologist Abdul Keylani, MD, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine at UNTHSC, inserted a stent to open Poythress' blocked artery. Afterward, Dr. Keylani calmed Poythress' worried wife, Barbara, by explaining the procedure at length.</p>  <p>Poythress, a retired mortgage banker, has depended on UNTHSC cardiologists to treat his artery disease for 17 years. And the reason is simple.</p>  <p>&quot;They spend the time with me,&quot; he said.</p>  <p>That means the physicians patiently talk to him about his condition in language he understands, Poythress said. They listen to him. Unlike doctors elsewhere, they never act hurried or distant.</p>  <p>Since undergoing quadruple bypass surgery in 1997, Poythress has undergone four cardiac catheterizations and had two cardiac stents inserted. He regularly sees cardiologist Geoffrey Kline, DO, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine, but praised the entire cardiology team.</p>  <p>&quot;They talk to you as a human being - someone they truly care about helping,&quot; said Poythress, who lives in Parker County.&nbsp; &quot;I do not believe I could find better care or a more professional group of doctors anywhere.&quot;</p>  <p>Today, Poythress feels good. He's back at his hobby of building furniture for friends and family in his wood shop.&nbsp; He recently wrote a letter thanking the Cardiology Department for 17 years of exceptional care. </p>  <p>He wrote: &quot;To you, I render my sincere appreciation for your professional treatment and your devotion to keeping me vertical.&quot; </p>",Patient Care,Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine,,,Photo1461,7/10/14 0:00,Cruisin for a cure to prostate cancer ,"<img src=""../../news/upload/Cruisin-banner-web.jpg"" alt=""Cowtown Cruisin' for a Cure"" title=""Cowtown Cruisin' for a Cure"" /><p>Much has changed since the nonprofit <a href=""http://www.cowtowncruisinforacure.org/"" target=""_blank"">Cowtown Cruisin' for a Cure</a> was founded in 2002 by prostate cancer survivor Chris Goetz to raise awareness of the disease in Tarrant County.  </p><p>The annual car show, fundraiser and cancer-screening event has grown from about 350 cars and 5,000 people to drawing now almost 500 cars and 20,000 people. </p>  <p>What hasn't changed is the organization's unwavering support of UNT Health Science Center's prostate cancer treatment research. Cowtown Cruisin' for a Cure has donated more than $100,000 in proceeds to support the research of Andras Lacko, PhD. </p>  <p>Dr. Lacko's research explores using nanoparticles to deliver anti-cancer medications directly to cholesterol-hungry cancer cells while avoiding damage to healthy cells. This could prevent the devastating effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea, hair loss, sores in the mouth and throat, and bone-marrow suppression.</p>  <p><img src=""../../news/upload/Cruising-chiefs-Lacko-web.jpg"" alt=""Cowtown Cruisin for a Cure with Lacko"" title=""Cowtown Cruisin for a Cure with Lacko"" hspace=""10"" align=""right"" />&quot;We have been very impressed by the exceptional research at the UNT Health Science Center and, specifically, Dr. Lacko's work,&quot; said Terry Mann, Cowtown Cruisin' for a Cure President. &quot;His research is very promising and fits perfectly with our goal to raise money to promote a cure for prostate cancer.&quot;</p>  <p>At a ceremony on Sept. 11 at the Moncrief Cancer Institute, Cruisin' for a Cure will give Dr. Lacko its Classic Heroes Award of Gratitude for his work. </p>  <p>Dr. Lacko, Professor of Integrative Physiology and Anatomy, called the nonprofit group one of the &quot;most generous and ardent supporters&quot; of his research. That support is especially important because of steady declines in available federal funding dollars for research.</p>  <p>&quot;Without the support of Cowtown Cruisin' for a Cure, our program could not have survived these difficult times,&quot; Dr. Lacko said.&nbsp;&quot;We are most appreciative of their support and hope to contribute to the cure of prostate cancer in the near future.&quot;</p>  ","Research, Community",Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences,Integrative Physiology and Anatomy,,
