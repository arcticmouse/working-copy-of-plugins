So Brandy Greene, senior auditor with UNT System, made an appointment for Jaylen to see Stuart Brown, MD, and Ryan Pham, DO, a dermatology resident at UNT Health Science Center. </p>  <p>Dr. Brown, who has several decades of experience in dermatology, oversees the UNTHSC Dermatology Division's resident doctor program. He recognized Jaylen's skin condition as a serious case of eczema - a common ailment that caused Jayden's face to turn dry and crusty. </p>  <p>Dr. Brown ordered up a prescription ointment and suggested ways the Greenes could moisturize Jaylen's skin. Jaylen's rash disappeared almost instantaneously. The itching stopped. He slept again.</p>  <p>Not only did Dr. Brown treat Jaylen's eczema, Brandy Greene said, but he diagnosed another skin abnormality in Jaylen -a small, harmless indention in his thigh where his skin did not fuse properly. </p>  <p>Several doctors were previously unable to identify the indention, so it was a relief to learn that it was nothing to worry about, Brandy Greene said.</p>  <p>Now that Jaylen's rash is gone, he is a happy baby again, Brandy Greene said.</p>  <p>&quot;Other parents at day care keep asking us what dermatologist we saw because Jaylen's skin looks so much better,&quot; she said. &quot;We were so happy with our experience at UNT Health.&quot;</p>",Patient Care,Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine,Dermatology,faculty,Photo1462,7/11/14 0:00,Taking the time to listen builds patient's trust and loyalty,"<img src=""../../news/upload/Jim-Pythress-with-care-team.jpg"" alt=""Jim Poythress with UNTHSC care team"" title=""Jim Poythress with UNTHSC care team"" /> <p>One weekend last March, Jim Poythress experienced chest pains and clammy skin.</p>  <p>Poythress, 76, who suffers from coronary artery disease, immediately contacted Nurse Practitioner Nancy Tierney, PhD, and sped to the emergency room. </p>  <p>The next morning, cardiologist Abdul Keylani, MD, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine at UNTHSC, inserted a stent to open Poythress' blocked artery.

Everything from the type of needle used to draw blood to the length of the storage time is specified in the guidelines.</p>  <p>Just as with blood tests for other diseases, such as diabetes, protocols must be established to make sure every lab performs the test exactly the same. Such guidelines are needed before FDA approval can be sought to use the test in a clinical setting.</p>  <p>&quot;With these guidelines, the next step is to do a clinical trial involving patients,&quot; Dr. O'Bryant said. &quot;That's never been done before.&quot;</p>   ",Research,Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine,Internal Medicine,"Alzheimer's, aging",1512,9/30/14,Psychologist incorporates yoga into psychotherapy sessions,"<img src=""../../news/upload/Jordan%20Mandy.jpg"" alt="""" hspace=""10"" width=""250"" align=""right"" />When you think of a psychologist&rsquo;s office, what do you envision?

<p>The colonoscopy, which looks for precancerous lesions called colon polyps, is considered the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening, he said. It is believed that most instances of colon cancer arise from colon polyps.</p>

<p>Age and risk factors can determine when a patient should undergo a colonoscopy. Patients should consult with their primary care physicians when deciding whether to get screened.</p>

Everyone around you seems to be sneezing, coughing and feeling feverish. How can you avoid from joining the sickly crowd?</p>

<p>The most important thing you can do to keep from getting sick is to wash your hands, says the Centers for Disease Control, so it&rsquo;s no coincidence that this week is National Hand Washing Week.</p>

<p>About 80 percent of all infectious diseases are transmitted by touch. Judicious hand washing can prevent not only common diseases like colds, but also more serious diseases like hepatitis A, meningitis, and infectious diarrhea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;National Hand Washing Week is a great opportunity to promote prevention,&rdquo; said Jan Jowitt, Director of Nursing Services and Infection Control Officer for UNT Health, the physicians group at UNT Health Science Center. &ldquo;Good hand hygiene is one of the most important techniques of illness prevention. Clean hands are happy hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Six Rules of Hand Washing</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Always wash hands after using the bathroom, changing diapers, cleaning up after your pets or handling money.</li>
	<li>Wash hands when they&rsquo;re dirty.</li>
	<li>Always wash hands before eating.</li>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t cough or sneeze into your hands.</li>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t put fingers in your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching people and surfaces with unclean hands.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Correct way to wash hands</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Wet hands with warm water (not hot) and use soap.</li>
	<li>Rub your hands together, making sure to scrub all areas.</li>
	<li>Rub for a minimum of 15 seconds or sing &ldquo;Happy Birthday.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Rinse thoroughly, then dry hands on a clean towel.</li>
	<li>Turn faucet off with the towel, not hands, to prevent recontamination.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>By the numbers:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>2/3 of adults in the U.S. wash hands after using the bathroom.</li>
	<li>1 in 4 adults don&rsquo;t wash hands after changing diapers.</li>
	<li>Less than 1/2 of Americans wash hands after cleaning up after pets.</li>
	<li>1 in 3 wash hands after sneezing/coughing.</li>
	<li>Less than 1 in 5 wash hands after touching money.</li>
	<li>1 in 3 E. coli occurrences is caused by not washing hands before handling food.</li>
</ul>

Free radicals are organic molecules responsible for aging and tissue damage. </p>  <p>&quot;Previous studies have shown that 20 to 28 percent of aging men have no response or a negative response to testosterone therapy,&quot; Dr. Cunningham said. &quot;About the same percentage of Caucasian men in our study also had adverse effects on cognitive dysfunction and inflammation.&quot;</p>  <p>These negative effects were only observed in men with high oxidative stress, said Dr. Cunningham, who will present the research at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in November.</p><p>The findings could help physicians determine which patients are most likely to benefit from testosterone replacement therapy using a simple blood test for oxidative stress and testosterone levels, Dr. Cunningham said.</p><p>Dr. Sid O'Bryant, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine; Dr. James Hall, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health; Dr. Meharvan Singh, Chairman and Professor of Pharmacology and Neuroscience; and Dr. Robert Barber, Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, also participated in the research.</p>",Research ,Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences,,,1305,10/30/13 0:00,Sleep tip: A consistent routine will help in adjusting to clock changes,"<p>A behavioral sleep specialist at UNT Health Science Center says &ldquo;falling back&rdquo; is easier than &ldquo;springing forward&rdquo; when it comes to clock changes.</p>

<p>The end of daylight saving time Sunday brings an extra hour of sleep and a relatively easy transition to the new clock schedule, said Brandy Roane, PhD, of UNTHSC&rsquo;s <a href=""http://web.unthsc.edu/info/200772/homepage"" target=""_blank"">Center for Sleep Medicine</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Biologically, it&rsquo;s the same reason why you don&rsquo;t experience as much jet lag when you travel west compared to traveling east,&rdquo; said Dr. Roane, Assistant Professor at the Health Science Center. &ldquo;Because our circadian clock operates on a 24.2-hour cycle, it&rsquo;s easier for us to stay up a little later than to go to bed a little earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep per night. For optimal sleep, Dr. Roane recommends consistent bedtimes and wake times seven days a week, and to avoid TVs, computers, smartphones and other sources of blue light 20 to 30 minutes before bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consistency is what&rsquo;s important,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The more you can get in a routine, the better your sleep will be.&rdquo;</p>

The USF team plans to exhume dozens of unmarked graves. Preliminary work on exhumations began Aug. 31 in Florida, with researchers uncovering the bodies of two children. Additional excavations will continue in the coming months, with remains expected to arrive at UNT Health Science Center later this year.</p>  <p>   <strong>What the Center does: </strong><br />Since 2003, the UNT Center for Human Identification (UNTCHI) has processed more than 5,150 human remains, making 1,151 DNA associations that led to identifications. In addition, the Center has analyzed more than 14,400 family reference samples, representing more than 8,000 missing person cases.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>  <p>UNTCHI conducts DNA analysis for all missing person cases that are under the auspices of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. It is the nation's only lab set in an academic center that is approved to upload genetic data for unidentified remains to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, a law-enforcement database better known as CODIS.</p>  <p>UNTCHI is one of only a few public sector laboratories to specialize in the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from skeletal remains. &nbsp;Because mtDNA is maternally inherited &shy;- and all individuals from the same maternal lineage share a common mtDNA profile &shy;- even distant relatives along the sample maternal lineage can be used as reference samples to help identify unknown decedents. Mitochondrial DNA is more abundant and more resistant to degradation than nuclear DNA, which is more routinely analyzed in forensic cases. The analysis of mtDNA is often the only chance of making identifications in cases of old skeletal remains. </p>  <p>Though a grant from the National Institute of Justice, UNT Health Science Center also maintains the National Missing and Unidentified Persons Systems (NamUs), a national clearinghouse for missing person cases, unidentified remains, unidentified living individuals and unclaimed bodies.</p>  <strong>Past cases</strong>:<br />In 2011, Eisenberg's lab identified a previously unnamed victim of Chicago serial killer John Wayne Gacy. The Center also worked on cases brought to it by the task force investigating Gary Ridgway, a murderer in the Seattle area better known as the Green River Killer. The Center and its forensic scientists have participated in large-scale efforts to identify victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina and the 1973 Pinochet military coup in Chile.

Of Tarrant County children ages 0-14, about 75,500 have asthma. By age 9, Sterling notes, 25 percent of the county's children are diagnosed with asthma, with a disproportionate number of cases among the county's African American children.</p>  <p>The Cook Children's Health Care 2009 Community-wide Children's Health Assessment &amp; Planning Survey showed childhood asthma rates of about 18.6 percent in Tarrant County, roughly double the national average of 9 percent and Texas' average of 8.8 percent.</p>  <p>This new initiative will focus on educating school-based health care providers, teachers and community-based primary care clinicians, as well as young patients, their parents and caregivers. Children will learn to manage their asthma to ultimately reduce school absences, asthma-related 911 calls from schools and resulting emergency visits, school clinic visits and hospital admissions or readmissions. The group hopes the pilot will grow into a self-sustaining program that can be rolled out throughout Fort Worth and other communities.</p>      <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""10"" width=""700"" align=""center"">  			<tbody> 			<tr> 			<td style=""background-color: #e7e8eb""> 			<strong>Asthma basics</strong> 			<p>This lung disease inflames and narrows the airways. </p><p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p><ul><li>wheezing</li><li>chest tightness</li><li>shortness of breath</li><li>coughing, often at night or early morning </li></ul><strong>Prevalence:</strong><p>Asthma affects people of all ages but most often starts in childhood.

Prevention is always the best medicine,&quot; said David Lar, MD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics. &quot;There's isn't a good treatment once you have contracted measles.&quot;</p>    <p><strong>Immunization guidelines: </strong>Children should receive their vaccinations at their one-year checkup and then a second dose between ages 4 and 6, Dr. Lar said.&nbsp;  </p><p><strong>Transmission:</strong> The <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/"" target=""_blank"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> says 90 percent of people who are close to an infected person will acquire measles if they are not immunized. It can be spread beginning about four days before the rash appears until about four days after it appears.</p>    <p>&quot;It is one of the most contagious illnesses that we know of,&quot; Dr. Lar said. &quot;It is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets from coughing and sneezing.&quot;</p>    <p><strong>Indications:</strong> Generally, measles symptoms appear in two stages. The first stage occurs within the first four days of infection and involves runny noses, coughs, conjunctivitis (red, watery eyes) and a mild to moderate fever. Stage 2 also lasts for about four days and includes a rash that starts at the head and spreads downward through the rest of the body, accompanied by a spike in fever.</p>  <p><strong>Complications:</strong> In some cases, measles can lead to pneumonia, seizures, brain infections and miscarriages. Such complications are more common in children younger than 5 and older than 20. Individuals with underlying medical conditions, such as those with compromised immune systems, are at higher risk of developing complications. Pregnant women are at higher risk of miscarriage, premature birth or having a low birth-weight baby because of measles, according to the CDC. </p>    <p>Infants and younger children are the most vulnerable, but anyone under 20 is generally more susceptible than an adult, Dr. Lar said.&nbsp; </p>                                                                                                  ",,,,,1262,8/20/13 0:00,UNTHSC and Cook Children's Northside Neighborhood Clinic foster FitTeens,"<p><img src=""../../news/upload/UNTHSC-FitTeens-Program.jpg"" alt=""UNTHSC FitTeens Program"" title=""UNTHSC FitTeens Program"" /> </p><p>Their pedometers continue to count their steps as they bound into the room at Cook Children's Northside Neighborhood Clinic, followed by proud parents.</p><p>They are participants in FitTeens, a motivational and family-based weight management program for kids ages 9 to 15 - led primarily by UNT Health Science Center students.</p><p>One teenager proudly shows her pedometer. &quot;I walked 3,246 steps this week!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I could have walked more, but I was sick for two days.&quot;</p><p>She receives $10 for returning her pedometer and starts setting goals on a special educational website.</p><p>FitTeens is designed to teach weight management skills in a compact, eight-week program with a strong online component.

It is one of five schools that make up the Health Science Center.</p><p>&quot;Since its founding, UNT Health Science Center has been an institution with a strong focus on primary care, and the College of Pharmacy supports that mission,&quot; said Michael R. Williams, DO, MD, MBA, President of the Health Science Center. &quot;Teamwork is essential in the health-care field, and pharmacists are a critical part of that team.&quot;</p><p>Under the leadership of its founding dean, Myron Jacobson, PhD, the College of Pharmacy will integrate research, medication management and teamwork across health professions. The program emphasizes the important relationship between patient and pharmacist.</p><p>&quot;A pharmacist's detailed knowledge of therapies is vital to finding healthy solutions for patients, and we want to ensure our graduates are at the forefront of that spectrum of patient care,&quot; said Dr. Jacobson, who is among approximately 20 faculty members leading the college.</p><p>The inaugural Class of 2017 comprises 82 students selected from among nearly 350 applicants. The majority of them are from Texas, with the largest block coming from the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p><p>They will undertake three years of classroom study, laboratory work and early clinical experiences. Fourth-year students cycle through advanced clinical rotations. At the end of their studies, students will receive a doctorate of pharmacy, known as a PharmD degree.</p>",,,,,1256,8/13/13 0:00,Risk factors for type 2 diabetes in pre-teens of Mexican descent,"<img src=""../../news/upload/UNTSC-Diabetes-Risk-Factors-Kim-Fulda.jpg"" alt=""UNTHSC Diabetes Risk Factors Kim Fulda"" title=""UNTHSC Diabetes Risk Factors Kim Fulda"" /> <p>Pre-teens of Mexican descent seem to be particularly prone to obesity and diabetes. To better care for this population, researchers at the UNT Health Science Center want to know if risk factors for type 2 diabetes in pre-teens of Mexican descent differ between those living in Mexico and those in North Texas.</p><p>With that in mind, UNTHSC has teamed up with the Universidad Aut&oacute;noma del Estado de M&eacute;xico (UAEM) to evaluate psychosocial, familial and environmental factors in children aged 10 to 14 who are of Mexican descent. Data gathered from kids in North Texas will be compared with data collected from kids in Toluca, Mexico. </p><p>Both the child and parent or guardian must agree to participate in the study, which includes a two-hour evaluation session during which researchers collect blood pressure, height, weight, waist and hip circumference, body mass indices, glucose levels and a lipid profile. Researchers also collect information about family structure, smoking status, body changes, diet and indications of depression, factors which often accompany obesity in adults. A quick neck inspection is used to check for Acanthosis Nigricans, a dark, velvety discoloration of the skin associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p><p>&quot;We hope to identify differences between children of Mexican descent in the U.S. and children in Mexico,&quot; explained Kim Fulda, DrPH, Principal Investigator at the Fort Worth location, Associate Director of the Primary Care Research Center, who is working closely with Roxana Vald&eacute;s-Ramos, DSc, from the UAEM in Toluca. </p><p>Evaluations of 150 young people in Mexico have been completed. The team in Fort Worth is finishing up evaluations of young Mexican American volunteers, then the data will be compared. </p><p>&quot;We hope to discover any protective differences in either location,&quot; explained Dr. Vald&eacute;s-Ramos. &quot;Perhaps children of Mexican descent in the U.S. have different stressors or diets that protect them or make them more vulnerable to obesity and type 2 diabetes.&quot;</p><p>The partnership between UAEM and UNTHSC is one of three projects underway between the two health-related institutions, although UAEM has had a relationship with UNT in Denton for 20 years.</p><p>&quot;This new relationship with UAEM is exciting and offers both institutions new opportunities for studying different populations, as well as sharing student and faculty learning experiences,&quot; said Thomas Yorio, PhD, UNTHSC Provost. </p>",,,,,1255,8/15/13 0:00,Governor appoints three to UNT System Board of Regents,"<table border=""0"" class=""image""> <tbody><tr><td><div style=""text-align: center""><img src=""../../news/upload/UNTHSC-New-Regents-Sworn-in.jpg"" alt=""UNTHSC New Regents Whitley Reid"" title=""UNTHSC New Regents Whitley Reid"" /></div></td></tr> <tr align=""center""><td class=""caption"">Left to right: UNT System Chancellor Lee Jackson and Board Secretary Julia Boyce swear in Regent Glen Whitley and Regent James &ldquo;Rusty&rdquo; Reid</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p>Texas Gov.

A patient's flu-like symptoms are getting worse, fast. But it's not flu season. And he has had several mosquito bites.&nbsp;   </p><p>Tests confirm your fears: He has the West Nile virus.</p>  <p>Your first priority is to help him survive a potentially lethal illness. But you also have another obligation.</p>  <p>The town has no public health department. There's no one to trap and test West Nile-carrying mosquitoes, no regulation of standing water, no spray trucks on standby. It's up to you to persuade the town council to take the action that could prevent more West Nile cases.</p>  <p>If you were trained in public health, you'd be prepared for this leadership role. An important part of public health is preventing disease through the organized efforts of communities and individuals.&nbsp; </p>  <p>That's why the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine's <a href=""http://web.unthsc.edu/ruralmed"">Rural Scholars program</a> and UNTHSC's <a href=""http://web.unthsc.edu/education/sph"">School of Public Health</a> now offer a dual degree in medicine and public health tailored specifically for rural scholars. </p>  <p>The dual DO/Master of Public Health degree debuts this fall.

The connection between the two keeps Ann Schreihofer, PhD, Associate Professor of Integrative Physiology, awake at night.<p>&quot;People with sleep apnea have a greater risk for developing high blood pressure,&quot; Schreihofer said. &quot;Blood pressure increases if the subjects live under conditions that mimic sleep apnea.&quot;</p><p>Schreihofer's lab focuses on the ways that the brain regulates blood pressure and how high blood pressure disrupts breathing during sleep.</p><p>&quot;The critical factor in sleep apnea that contributes to increasing blood pressure is the occurrence of intermittent episodes of low oxygen levels - hypoxia - due to periodic cessation of breathing while sleeping,&quot; she said. &quot;Placing subjects in special chambers that induce intermittent hypoxia during sleep has been shown to lead to high blood pressure that persists even when the subjects are awake and not exposed to hypoxia.</p><p>&quot;This is what occurs in people with obstructive sleep apnea,&quot; Schreihofer said.</p><p>Schreihofer believes that the neurons in the brain that regulate breathing also influence the neurons that regulate cardiovascular functions. Her goal is to map out the ways that these neurons are connected in the brain stem and to understand how their interactions may be affected by exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia.  <br />&quot;We anticipate that these studies will provide novel insights into the ways that obstructive sleep apnea leads to high blood pressure, Schreihofer said.</p><p>She hopes that her research may assist physicians who treat patients with hypertension - to customize patient treatment and medications aligned with the person's individual medical issues, rather than on the most cost-effective blood pressure medication available..</p><p>&quot;Hypertension develops from multiple causes.  Optimal treatments may vary depending upon the underlying origins of the disease. Personalized treatment of hypertensive people may enhance outcomes,&quot; she concluded.</p>",,,,,1252,8/7/13 0:00,"Research into homeless women reveals their situation, needs","<p>&quot;Treat us with respect. Just because we are homeless, and we have been broken down so low, doesn't mean we aren't human.&quot;</p><p>For two semesters, Emily Spence-Almaguer, PhD, School of Public Health Associate Professor of Behavioral and Community Health, has worked with a group of UNTHSC graduate students to identify the victimization experiences and health challenges of homeless women in Fort Worth's East Lancaster area.</p><p>In partnership with the Tarrant County Homeless Coalition - and working with the Salvation Army, Presbyterian Night Shelter and Day Resource Center for the Homeless - the professor and 10 of her students conducted 150 face-to-face interviews with women living on the streets and in emergency shelters, to understand their life stories and report the findings on areas of need.</p><p>The average participant was female, 43 years old and had been homeless for just over two years. The age at which many first became homeless was 34, while more than one-third reported becoming homeless in their 40s and 50s. Most had a high school diploma or GED, with 47 percent being African American, 39 percent Caucasian, and 8 percent Hispanic.</p><p>Titled &quot;It Happens out Here,&quot; the presentation shared data on the health and safety risks to these women, from theft, threats, physical and sexual violence, stalking and verbal abuse, to psychological trauma and injuries resulting in physical disability and chronic pain. Over 60 percent of participants reported facing these types of threats in the prior 12 months while homeless. One in every six interviewed said she had sought medical treatment for injuries stemming from victimization. Prior research conducted with Tarrant County's homeless indicated that violence and victimization were concerns, but no previous studies had systematically explored the issues and specific women's health consequences in this way.</p><p>Final survey questions were designed to shift the focus from problems to solutions and identify the resiliency strategies employed by women. Recommendations from participants included opening a women's only shelter; expanding current shelters to bring more women in from the streets; focusing on permanent housing placement, job training, education and life skills; strengthening networks for counseling and support programs, including increased substance abuse and mental health services; and empowering women to take control of their own safety through self-defense and other protection programs.</p>",,,,,1251,8/2/13 0:00,Making kidneys more efficient in diabetics,"Diabetes is a debilitating metabolic condition that affects the kidneys, among other organs, causing them to malfunction and eventually fail to perform their job in ridding the body of toxins. Kidneys clean blood in a process called glomerular filtration. But when too much or too little filtration occurs, the blood isn't cleaned or dehydration results from water loss. Filtration is regulated by glomerular cell contraction.<p>Rong Ma, PhD, Associate Professor of Integrative Physiology, is searching for the reason that glomerular cells become impaired. Is it a result of Types I and II diabetes?</p><p>&quot;When glomerular cells relax, filtration increases,&quot; explained Ma. &quot;When the cells contract, filtration decreases. So what causes the impairment of the cell contraction in diabetes? We suspect it is a dysfunction of the ion channel TRPC6 (Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 6). With hyperglycemia --- high level of blood sugar --- the number of TRPC6 channels is reduced, which decreases cell contraction and increases filtration in the kidneys in diabetes.&quot;</p><p>Eventually, a drug or molecular tool that could regulate expression level of TRPC6 could be administered, and the ravaging effects of diabetes on the kidneys could be reduced.</p><p>&quot;We are still in the early stages of determining how to reduce the number of functional channels and increase kidney filtration, &quot;Ma said. &quot;But the results of our research could help give diabetes patients more effective treatment and reduce the negative effects of diabetes on the kidneys.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,1250,8/1/13 0:00,Can nicotine actually heal the brain?,"Nicotine typically conjures up images of cigarettes and smoking, addiction, cancer and lung disease. But not so for Victor Uteshev, PhD, Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, who sees nicotine as an opportunity for good. <p> Uteshev's research concentrates on the positive effects chemicals such as nicotine may have on the brain - as in enhancing cognitive performance and resistance to brain injury, particularly in aging patients and people who have high risk for stroke and traumatic brain injury.</p><p>&quot;When people smoke or use a nicotine patch or even chew nicotine gum, nicotine gets in the bloodstream and in the brain, and binds to certain receptors - which ultimately create an electric current in neurons,&quot; said Uteshev. &quot;It changes the electrochemical status of the neuron. The neuron becomes slightly different - more excited and more resilient - and releases other chemicals which trigger a system of events which change the entire chemical environment in the brain.&quot;</p><p>This environmental change can be either positive or negative, Uteshev said. &quot;In the case of smoking, the change can result in negative health effects such as deficits in cardiovascular function and cancer.&quot;</p><p>This change in brain chemicals also has proven to be beneficial, in optimal doses. &quot;Some smokers can think more clearly for a few minutes or so after a cigarette,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We are focusing on compounds that are similar to nicotine but can bring mostly positive effects. In many diseases and pathological conditions, the brain doesn't create enough of these nicotine receptors and natural compounds that activate these receptors. In diseases and conditions such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injury, the level of activation of nicotine receptors is deficient and cannot support normal brain function. Our goal is to develop clinically tested drug therapies that can compensate for these deficits and improve or restore cognitive and autonomic functions in patients with age, disease and trauma-related impairments.&quot;</p>.",,,,,1249,7/31/13 0:00,UNTHSC nurtures scientists at summer research intern program,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>        1024x768   </xml><![endif]--><p>Twenty-seven undergraduate scientists from across the U.S. have been hard at work this summer learning to conduct biomedical research as part of the <a href=""http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/RISE/"">Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (RISE) program</a>.</p>    <p>The annual summer outreach programs ---<a href=""../../outreach/smart.cfm"">Summer Multicultural Advanced Research Training Program (SMART)</a><strong>; </strong><a href=""http://web.unthsc.edu/info/20004/graduate_school_of_biomedical_sciences/1236/summer_training_among_research_scientists_stars_program"">Summer Training Among Research Scientists Program (STARS)</a>; and the <a href=""../../gsbs/HBCUSummer.cfm"">HBCU Undergraduate Collaborative Summer Training Program in Prostate Cancer</a> --- are designed to familiarize undergraduate students with the varied disciplines and methodologies used in biomedical research and are sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program and the Joe and Jessie Crump Foundation for Medical Research through JPMorgan Bank, respectively.

COPD is responsible for one death every four minutes in the U.S. By 2020, COPD is expected to be the third most common cause of death in the country. While primary care providers are the most likely health care providers to test for the disease, they often refer patients to pulmonology specialists for the simple test using a spirometer.<p>The Texas Prevention Institute (TPI) worked with NorTex investigators, the UNTHSC Department of Family Medicine and the Office of Professional and Continuing Education to determine how physician use of spirometry can affect and improve treatment of COPD.</p><p>As a benchmark, the researchers surveyed physicians, physician assistants and residents about their knowledge, beliefs and practices using spirometers with their patients to detect COPD. These health care professionals were then trained on when to use the device and how to interpret results.  Finally, the research team went back to determine if the physicians had increased use of spirometers in the physician's office, saving the patient an additional trip to a pulmonologist for this simple test.</p><p>Early results show that the educational programs increased the use of spirometry in primary care offices, leading to earlier diagnosis of and outcomes for COPD.</p>",,,,,1234,7/8/13 0:00,Michael Williams featured by US News & World Report,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                             MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>        </xml><![endif]-->  <p>Michael Williams, DO, MD, MBA, Interim President of the UNT Health Science Center, is the featured member of the <a href=""http://usnewshospitaloftomorrow.com/profiles/michael-williams-do-md-mba/""><em>US News &amp; World Report</em> Hospital of Tomorrow</a> advisory council this month on its web site.</p><p>The Hospital of Tomorrow is a panel of notable health care executives tasked with guiding the development of a national forum Nov. 4-6, 2013, in Washington, D.C.</p><p>The forum is designed to address critical challenges facing the health care industry and will meet regularly to spotlight pioneering strategies and create solutions to help industry leaders navigate the changing health care landscape.</p>  <p><a href=""http://usnewshospitaloftomorrow.com/profiles/michael-williams-do-md-mba/"">Read Williams' <em>US News &amp; World Report</em> profile</a>.</p>      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                             </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style> <![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:""Times New Roman"",""serif"";} </style> <![endif]-->",,,,,1233,7/3/13 0:00,Nanoparticles smuggle anti-cancer drugs,"<p>Andras Lacko, PhD, is about to take a major step forward in his more than 10 years of cancer research.

For those struggling to pay electric bills or buy groceries, scheduling a mammogram isn't high on their priority list. </p>  <p>To help change that dynamic, Kathryn Cardarelli, PhD, Associate Professor of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health, and her team address these issues during eight-week breast health education programs in economically challenged parts of Dallas County. The Dallas Cancer Disparities Research Coalition serves approximately 200 women per year and has earned a three-year grant from the Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas.</p>    <p>The coalition's goal is to remove barriers between high-risk women in Dallas and the breast cancer preventive care they need. Things like fear of fatalism, lack of transportation and economic hardship prevent these women from actively seeking screenings. Lay health educators go door-to-door, and more often than not, through the door, to persuade women to participate in the program.</p>    <p>&quot;We meet people where they are - in their homes,&quot; Cardarelli said. &quot;Sometimes our staff ends up holding a baby or stirring a pot of food on the stove just to talk to them about the program and encourage them to enroll.&quot;</p>    <p>&quot;That's why our program is so different,&quot; adds Lay Health Educator Phyllis Harris. &quot;As a team, we've tapped into areas that most programs run from. We're not afraid to go in uncharted territory.&quot;</p>    <p>The program participants meet weekly for 90 minutes in a community location to learn how to eat healthy on a budget, how to talk to their doctor, faith and wellness, and methods of early detection, among other things. Upon completing the classes, a graduation ceremony is held to honor the participants' commitment and to encourage them to become community resources.</p>    <p>&quot;The most important thing the program offers is that it teaches participants to value their health and themselves,&quot; Cardarelli said. </p>    <p>The grant covers free screening mammograms for each participant who is asymptomatic and has not been screened within the last year. Since the program began in 2007, 24 percent of participants who completed surveys had never received a screening mammogram and 6.8 percent had not received one in the last five years. Upon completion of the program, 82 percent of the women were eligible for a screening mammogram. If screenings show that follow-up is needed, the participants receive more information about next steps.</p>  <p>&quot;I am so proud to see how much of an impact our program has made in the lives of so many women in underserved communities,&quot; said Harris.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>CPRIT grant # PP110190</p>",,,,,1226,6/20/13 0:00,"Students brave bugs, burns and bears for rotation at Yellowstone ","<table border=""0"" class=""image"" align=""right""> <tbody><tr><td><img src=""../../news/upload/rachael-yellowstone.jpg"" alt=""Racael Mayfield Yellowstone Rotation"" title=""Racael Mayfield Yellowstone Rotation"" width=""350"" height=""398"" /></td></tr> <tr><td class=""caption"">Rachael Mayfield, MPAS ('13), at Yellowstone National Park<br /></td></tr> </tbody></table> <p>With more than 3 million visitors every year, Yellowstone National Park offers ample opportunity for appreciating the wonders of nature.

The program is a joint effort of the Wilderness Medical Society and Medcor, the medical services outsourcing company that operates Yellowstone's two clinics.</p><p>Mayfield supported staff physician assistants and nurse practitioners as they treated patients for routine things like mild sunburns, dehydration, lacerations and insect bites. But there were more esoteric and place-related complaints, too: fly-fish hook removal, altitude sickness, even asthma exacerbated by sulfur fumes from the park's famous hot springs.</p><p>Rene York (PAS '14), heads to Yellowstone this month for her rotation and she and Mayfield have already talked about expectations. What advice did Mayfield offer to the aspiring family practitioner?</p><p>&quot;Rachael told me to expect to wear multiple hats,&quot; says York. &quot;There are only four people at the clinic at any one time, so I'll be expected to help out in all aspects of running a clinic including patient care, procedures, billing, radiology, pharmacy, stocking and cleaning and maintenance. I'm looking forward to all of it.&quot;</p><p>Mayfield also says that her patient responsibilities were varied. &quot;My rotation was a great mixture of primary care, emergency, rural medicine, pediatrics, geriatrics and women's health. About half of the patients were visitors, both domestic and international, and half were park employees who worked in the lodges, hotels, restaurants, stores, fisheries and other areas. They gave me a lot of experience with work-related injuries. The providers were great and they pushed me to be more active in patient care and to get out of my comfort zone.&quot;</p><p>Mayfield says the only thing she regrets is that the experience was over so quickly. &quot;The time just flew by. It was an unforgettable experience and I'm thankful I was able to learn so much in such a short period and meet such interesting people, too.

The connection between the two keeps Ann Schreihofer, PhD, Associate Professor of Integrative Physiology, awake at night.    <p>&quot;People with sleep apnea have a greater risk for developing high blood pressure,&quot; Schreihofer said. &quot;Blood pressure increases if the subjects live under conditions that mimic sleep apnea.&quot;</p>   <p>Schreihofer's lab focuses on the ways that the brain regulates blood pressure and how high blood pressure disrupts breathing during sleep.</p>  <p>&quot;The critical factor in sleep apnea that contributes to increasing blood pressure is the occurrence of intermittent episodes of low oxygen levels - hypoxia - due to periodic cessation of breathing while sleeping,&quot; she said. &quot;Placing subjects in special chambers that induce intermittent hypoxia during sleep has been shown to lead to high blood pressure that persists even when the subjects are awake and not exposed to hypoxia.</p>  <p>&quot;This is what occurs in people with obstructive sleep apnea,&quot; Schreihofer said.</p>    <p>Schreihofer believes that the neurons in the brain that regulate breathing also influence the neurons that regulate cardiovascular functions. Her goal is to map the ways that these neurons are connected in the brain stem and to understand how their interactions may be affected by exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia.&nbsp; </p>  <p>&quot;We anticipate that these studies will provide novel insights into the ways that obstructive sleep apnea leads to high blood pressure,&quot; Schreihofer said.</p>  <p>She hopes that her research may assist physicians who treat patients with hypertension to customize patient treatment and medications aligned with the person's individual medical issues, rather than on the most cost-effective blood pressure medication available.</p>  <p>&quot;Hypertension develops from multiple causes.&nbsp; Optimal treatments may vary depending upon the underlying origins of the disease.

But if you're a member of Kid's Initiative, you're not just into the mayhem: you're aiding and abetting it.  <p>As conceived in 2011 by Travis Urban (SHP '13), Kid's Initiative would plant two seeds of thought with children attending North High Mount Elementary, the Title 1 school neighboring UNTHSC's campus: physical fitness as a key element of health, and awareness of UNT Health Science Center as a solution for healthier communities. </p>    <p>&quot;Other than seeing a doctor or nurse, many kids in this demographic don't know much about the health care profession,&quot; says Urban, who understands what he calls &quot;both side of the tracks.&quot; Adding that &quot;physical therapy should be at the forefront of the fight against obesity,&quot; he notes that &quot;nobody's better at teaching safe movement than a physical therapist.&quot;</p>        <p>&quot;We have fun with the kids and it's contagious,&quot; enthuses Roseann Luna, (SHP '14). Meena Krishnan (SHP '14) agrees, adding that &quot;they're really well behaved and look forward to every Tuesday, which charges all of us up, too.&quot;</p>    <p>North High Mount Elementary's Principal Todd Koppes was onboard with the Kid's Initiative early on, but insisted that the School of Health Professions students &quot;honor any commitment you make to these kids.&quot; Urban explains: &quot;If we say we're going to be there, then we must be there. Some of the kids come from broken homes and breaking their trust even once could lose them for good.&quot; </p>  <p>Wendy Walling, High Mount's PE teacher, praises the Kid's Initiative volunteers. &quot;We have been so grateful for all their help not only with morning exercise but with our special events such as Field Day, Family Fitness Night and fund raising for our school,&quot; she says. &quot;The students are enthusiastic, and it's great to have the community involvement.

It's called <a href=""../../ruralmed/Home.cfm"" target=""_blank"">Rural Osteopathic Medical Education of Texas</a> (ROME). These Rural Scholars visit a rural clinic and its physician before ever setting foot in a classroom. The relationship with practicing physicians and other providers continues throughout the student's medical education.</p><p>The community-based curriculum introduces student doctors to the rural environment. They work with faculty preceptors from rural communities across the state. They can &quot;try on&quot; the life of a rural physician to see how it fits. US News &amp; World Report ranked the program ranked 15th in the nation this year. </p><p>In addition:</p><ul><li>84 percent of ROME graduates entered a primary care residency</li></ul><ul><li>60 percent of ROME graduates entered family practice residencies</li></ul><p><strong>Playing many roles</strong></p><p>&quot;The rural physician doesn't have the luxury of referring patients to specialists,&quot; says John Bowling, DO, Professor and Assistant Dean of Rural Medical Education. &quot;In towns like Comanche or Bastrop, the rural health professional has to be prepared for just about anything. One of our adjunct faculty in Eagle Lake even helped organize the influx of thousands of people racing away from a hurricane on the Texas coast. Our students are immersed in the rural lifestyle in their first year and learn to wear many hats.&quot;</p><p>The rural physician will likely be called upon for leadership in diverse settings - nursing home medical director, athletics team physician, hospice director. &quot;One of our adjunct faculty is a 4-H judge in Eastland. Another is emergency services director in Liberty,&quot; Bowling says. &quot;The community often dictates how the physician can best serve.&quot;</p><p><strong>Benefits of rural practice</strong></p><p>A common myth is that physicians avoid the rural setting because they won't be able to repay large medical school loans or support a family. In fact, the rural family physician is more likely in his own clinic to provide colonoscopies, bone density scans, minor surgery and obstetrics, than can his urban counterparts. These procedures are highly reimbursable and should enable the doctor to meet his financial obligations. The rural physician in Texas earns a good living.</p><p>&quot;You can raise a family in a less hectic environment, be intricately involved in the success of a town and be appreciated by the community you serve,&quot; Bowling says.</p>",,,,,1212,5/13/13 0:00,Osteopathic manipulative treatment improves speech for child with apraxia,"	 		<p> 			<img src=""../../news/upload/Gustowski-OMM-Apraxia.jpg"" alt=""Gustowski OMM Apraxia"" title=""Gustowski OMM Apraxia"" /> 		</p> 		<p> 			What would you do if you knew what you wanted to say, but physically, you could not put the sounds and words together to form a sentence? If you are like 3-year-old Charlie Lain, who suffers from childhood apraxia of speech, producing words is a daily struggle. 		</p> 		<p> 			Apraxia is a neurological speech disorder that affects a child's ability to clearly and correctly produce simple sounds, syllables and words. The most obvious thing that others notice is that the child is unable to speak, or has significantly limited and/or unclear speech.&nbsp; Apraxia is among the most severe speech and communication problems in children.&nbsp; Yet most people have never heard of the disorder.&nbsp; While it is not life-threatening, apraxia is certainly life-altering for children and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;That has certainly been the case for the Lains. 		</p> 		<p> 			Although Charlie was born as a seemingly healthy full-term baby, he quickly developed a respiratory condition called persistent pulmonary hypertension of a newborn (PPHN), which occurs when the baby's circulation system does not adapt to breathing outside the womb.&nbsp; Because of this, he had to be intubated when he was just hours old, and he spent the first few weeks of his life in the NICU fighting against, and then recovering from, PPHN.&nbsp; 		</p> 		<p> 			Charlie has struggled to make sounds since he was a baby and has been under the care of doctors and highly-trained therapists for almost two years. At the suggestion of his occupational therapist, Charlie's mother, Jill, took him to see <strong>Sharon Gustowski, DO</strong>, a UNT Health osteopathic manipulative medicine physician, for an evaluation. 		</p>  		<table border=""0"" cellpadding=""10"" width=""350"" align=""right""> 			<tbody> 				<tr> 					<td style=""background-color: #e7e8eb""> 						<strong>Signs of Apraxia</strong> 						<p> 							A Very Young Child: 						</p> 						<ul> 							<li>Does not coo or babble as an infant 							</li> 							<li>First words are late, and they may be missing sounds 							</li> 							<li>Only a few different consonant and vowel sounds 							</li> 							<li>Problems combining sounds; may show long pauses between sounds 							</li> 							<li>Simplifies words by replacing difficult sounds with easier ones or by 							</li> 							<li>deleting difficult sounds (although all children do this, the child with 							</li> 							<li>apraxia of speech does so more often) 							</li> 							<li>May have problems eating 							</li> 						</ul> 						<p> 							An Older Child: 						</p> 						<ul> 							<li>Makes inconsistent sound errors that are not the result of immaturity 							</li> 							<li>Can understand language much better than he or she can talk 							</li> 							<li>Has difficulty imitating speech, but imitated speech is more clear than spontaneous speech 							</li> 							<li>May appear to be groping when attempting to produce sounds or to coordinate the lips, tongue, and jaw for purposeful movement 							</li> 							<li>Has more difficulty saying longer words or phrases clearly than shorter ones 							</li> 							<li>Appears to have more difficulty when he or she is anxious 							</li> 							<li>Is hard to understand, especially for an unfamiliar listener 							</li> 							<li>Sounds choppy, monotonous, or stresses the wrong syllable or word 							</li> 						</ul> 						<p> 							Source: <a href=""http://www.asha.org/"" target=""_blank"">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</a> 						</p> 					</td> 				</tr> 			</tbody> 		</table> 		<p> 			After learning about Charlie's condition, Dr. Gustowski started helping him using osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMT). OMT is a set of techniques that gently guides muscles and bones back into place to reduce and eliminate muscle and joint restrictions that can interfere with normal function.&nbsp;&nbsp; 		</p> 		<p> 			Dr. Gustowski found areas of on Charlie's body that had muscle and joint tightness, including his hips, low back, jaw, neck and shoulders.&nbsp; These issues probably occurred around his birth and intubation for his PPHN. In Charlie's case, Dr. Gustowski felt that using OMT on his head, jaw and neck helped him gain more control over the muscles he uses to plan sounds and words, most likely making it easier for him to speak.&nbsp; Likewise, removing tightness in his pelvic muscles and joints also is making it easier for him to walk, run and jump.&nbsp; 		</p> 		<p> 			For the first time in Charlie's life, he is able to communicate basic wants and needs with his family.&nbsp; Jill credits his intensive speech therapy program, in addition to Dr. Gustowski's treatments, for his improvement. While Charlie has only been a patient at UNTHSC since January, Jill hopes future visits with Dr. Gustowski will continue to help him improve his speech and muscle tone. 		</p> 		<p> 			Jill says of Dr. Gustowski, &quot;She has a passion for children, and she is vested in 		</p> 		<p> 			Charlie's care. She is humble, knowledgeable and someone I could be friends with. She expects excellence from her students that join her during Charlie's visits, and she is modeling for them how to care for young children. &nbsp;I am so thankful for everything she has done for Charlie and am excited to see what his progress will be down the road.&quot; 		</p> 		<p> 			Many health conditions and disorders have special days to raise awareness.&nbsp; The first-ever National Apraxia Awareness Day will be held on May 14 to educate the public about apraxia and provide support to families who are affected by it. Many insurance companies, including Charlie's, do not cover treatment for apraxia, so most of these families are forced to pay for speech and occupational therapies out of their own pockets.&nbsp; Thankfully, Charlie's OMT visits with Dr. Gustowski are covered by his family's plan. 		</p> 		<p> 			&quot;The body has an amazing ability to heal itself, and children especially demonstrate this because they grow and change so fast,&quot; said Dr. Gustowski.&nbsp; &quot;OMT can help remove obstacles that are in the muscles and bones.&nbsp; It's been fun working with Charlie, to see where his body needs a little help, and especially to see his progress.&nbsp; He is a bright, kind young man with a loving and supportive family, and that support is a very valuable part of the healing process.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; 		</p> 		<p> 			To schedule an appointment with Dr. Gustowski, or any of our osteopathic manipulative medicine physicians, call 817-735-DOCS (3627). 		</p> 		<p> 			For more information about apraxia, visit: <a href=""http://www.apraxia-kids.org/"">http://www.apraxia-kids.org</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<em>(This story was broadcast on <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/unthsc/omtapraxia"">KLIF radio </a>on May 14.)</em></p>  ",,,,,1211,5/9/13 0:00,May events at the UNT Health Science Center,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]-->  <p><strong>May 10</strong> - <a href=""../../research/forher/documents/livingwell.pdf"">Living Well Aware Conference</a>, Friday, May 10, 11:30 am to 5 p.m.,<strong> </strong>UNT Health Science Center Medical Education &amp; Training (MET) Building (Rooms - 109/110/111), 1000 Montgomery Street, Fort Worth, TX 76107.&nbsp; $45.00 per person (includes lunch, breaks and course syllabus.

He runs his own practice and serves as Director of Neurosurgery at Presbyterian Hospital of Plano.</p><p>Newsweek and American Way magazines both have named him among the top neurosurgeons in the country based on feedback from his peers. To achieve these victories, he's had his share of challenges.</p><p><strong>Challenge #1: Academics</strong></p><p>Dickerman started a PhD program in Biochemistry/Molecular Biology at the <a href=""http://web.unthsc.edu/education/gsbs/"" target=""_blank"">Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> (GSBS) in 1992 while working nights as a medicinal and laboratory chemist for Alcon Laboratories. If that's not hard enough, he decided to continue his PhD studies when he was accepted to the <a href=""http://www.unthsc.edu/education/tcom/"" target=""_blank"">Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine</a>.</p><p>He was named to Who's Who in American Universities as a GSBS student and to the Sigma Sigma Phi Honor Society and as a Chancellor's Award recipient as a TCOM student. He is one of few neurosurgeons with dual fellowships in brain and spinal surgery.</p><p><strong>Challenge #2: Residency</strong></p><p>After graduating, Dickerman knew he wanted to be a neurosurgeon and landed a prestigious neurosurgery fellowship at the National Institutes of Health. Then he needed a neurosurgery residency - and there are fewer than 100 in the United States. Of the 11 he applied to, he got his 11th choice - North Shore University-Long Island Jewish Medical Center, an 800-bed facility.</p><p>&quot;When I got there, I was thrown into the fire - suddenly there was somebody's brain in front of me,&quot; Dickerman remembers. &quot;I wanted to quit every day because it was so hard and I was so tired. But I saw everything [related to neurosurgery],&quot; adding he still hasn't seen some of the conditions he treated there during the more than eight years he's been in private practice.</p><p>As usual, he took on the challenge, becoming chief resident. Now he says, &quot;Thank God I went there. If I had gotten some plush residency, I wouldn't have been as well prepared when I got out. God had a plan.&quot;</p><p><img src=""../../news/upload/Dickerman-UNTHSC-Alumni-2.jpg"" alt=""UNTHSC Dickerman Alumni TCOM 2"" title=""UNTHSC Dickerman Alumni TCOM 2"" width=""330"" height=""367"" align=""right"" /><strong>Challenge #3: The field of neurosurgery</strong></p><p>Neurosurgery can be a brutal medical specialty. These specialists are on call for trauma cases and often find themselves addressing serious brain or spinal cord injuries after only minutes of preparation.</p><p>&quot;There are a lot of risks,&quot; Dickerman acknowledges, &quot;but you can help a lot of people.&quot;</p><p>Dickerman thrives on the challenge, and says his TCOM training helped set him up for success.</p><p>&quot;There is nothing you can't do if you are from that school [TCOM],&quot; Dickerman said. &quot;I'm proof of that. Students there have a huge opportunity to go anywhere they want to go and help whomever they want to help - it's up to them. The fact that I got in is a blessing.&quot;</p><p>Dickerman keeps the whole patient in mind. Many people travel hundreds of miles to see him. He's a specialist in sophisticated surgeries, including pioneering minimally invasive techniques, yet is cautious about performing them.</p><p>&quot;Nine out of 10 patients don't need me,&quot; he said. &quot;They just need to fix their diet and exercise. When they tell me they don't have time, I tell them to make time. They feel better and give me the credit. But they really did what it took to get better.&quot;</p><p>Dickerman's dedication and determination to conquer challenges means that it's his patients who ultimately win.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,1207,5/1/13 0:00,Dr. Woerner's care during pregnancy motivated this patient to get better,"<p>The joy of bringing a baby into the world is all-encompassing. But sometimes, so are the painful physical changes that a woman experiences as her body responds to a pregnancy.</p><p>Consider Cessilye Smith. Her first pregnancy led to a diastasis, a separation of abdominal muscles, which was never addressed. Two years later she is currently pregnant with her second, and she started having severe low back and pelvic pain that would hurt so bad she was leaving work early because of the pain. She was scared because her paychecks were diminishing and she was using valuable leave time she wanted to save for when the baby came. She turned to Marie Woerner, a UNT Health Physical Therapist for help, and is now able to work her regular shifts without being sent home in pain.</p><p>Woerner practices at both the <a href=""http://www.unthsc.edu/campusmap/default.cfm"" target=""_blank"">UNT Health Patient Care Center</a> on campus and the UNT Health at Alliance clinic. She specializes in women's health, including care during pregnancy and postpartum; and fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, pelvic floor, and lymphedema. She also treats patients with general orthopedic conditions ranging from low-back pain to post-surgical issues. Woerner is one of the few Tarrant County physical therapists who treats pelvic pain problems in both men and women.</p><p>&quot;Not knowing what's wrong with you is so scary,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Dr. Woerner immediately made me see the light at the end of the tunnel and gave me the motivation I needed to get better.&quot;</p><p>Smith's treatment included a routine of stretching, valuable education and stabilization exercises. The treatment worked quickly: in just a few sessions, Smith's diastasis improved as well as her lower extremity and transverse abdominis strength, she was able to reclaim her life.</p><p>&quot;Since I started physical therapy, I've been able to do extra chores around the house and work full shifts at work, too,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Dr. Woerner knows what she's doing, and she's been amazing for me.&quot;</p><p>To make an appointment with Marie Woerner, call 817-735-2100 or 817-735-5400.

The economic cost estimates associated with HIV/AIDS exceed 36 billion dollars a year. Effective antiretroviral (ARV) drug treatments have helped people with HIV to live longer. However, a highly effective and widely prescribed antiretroviral drug, efavirenz, can also cause adverse neuropsychiatric side effects including depression, anxiety, aggressive behavior, night terrors, hallucinations, psychosis and delusions. Recently efavirenz has been diverted for recreational use when the pills are crushed and smoked for a high.<p>John Schetz, PhD, Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, recently applied his expertise to help solve the mystery as to why efavirenz, when taken as prescribed, can cause adverse neuropsychiatric events, and why it may be attractive for recreational use. This later use is a potential public health concern because improper dosing could encourage the development of ARV-resistant HIV strains.</p><p>Dr. Schetz and colleagues hope their findings will help generate support for additional studies aimed at preventing ARV side effects and abuse. Re-engineering a highly effective ARV drug  that lacks adverse neuropsychiatric side effects and abuse potential could foster patient compliance, reduce the likelihood of HIV drug resistant strains and prevent illicit use of HIV medications.</p>",,,,,1205,4/24/13 0:00,Interprofessional education gets new emphasis,"The Health Science Center is creating a new culture of interprofessionalism under the leadership of David Farmer, PhD, Director of Interprofessional Practice.

Medical and nursing students trained together to improve their understanding of each profession's roles and responsibilities in a code situation.</p><p>The UNTHSC Interprofessional Education (IPE) Steering Committee was created to develop interprofessional collaboration across all UNTHSC schools and includes a dean, associate dean or faculty member from each school. Collaborative projects include Interprofessional SAGE (<a href=""../../news/newsrelease.cfm?ID=1132"">Seniors Assisting in Geriatric Education</a>), a school of public health administration IPE honors course, an interprofessional student coalition dynamic discussion on obesity, the code simulation and faculty training.

In March, 13 first-year students in Rural Osteopathic Medicine Education (ROME) traveled more than 100 miles north to experience first-hand how an osteopathic physician partners with a local employer.<p>John Bowling, DO, Professor and Assistant Dean of Rural Medical Education, said students benefit a great deal from spending time in a rural community and gathering information about its unique medical needs. On this trip, students visited the Red River town of Bonham, TX (pop. 10,000). Clayton Homes employs more than 200 people and is crucial to the community. Also crucial is the physician who looks out for those workers' health and safety, Jim Tarpley, DO (TCOM &lsquo;00). A native of the area, he has a family practice in Bonham and also serves as Clayton Homes' occupational medicine physician.</p>&quot;We got a terrific glimpse at life in a rural community and how a physician plays a vital role within it,&quot; said Russ Wier (TCOM '16).<br /><p>Wier will be learning under Dr. Tarpley's supervision throughout the next four years - each rural student is assigned to a Family Medicine Continuity Site where he/she spends increasing amounts of time in the physician's practice and in the community (see sidebar).</p>Other occupational field trips have taken ROME students to a dairy farm in the Central Texas town of Dublin and a cotton gin in Ropesville in West Texas.<br />",,,,,1203,4/10/13 0:00,"TCOM celebrates National Osteopathic Medicine Week with seminars, public health screenings","National Osteopathic Medicine (NOM) Week is <strong>April 14-20</strong>.

Traveling alone to Luanda, Angola, Africa, on her first international flight, she arrived to find her workplace circled with barbed wire in a city still largely lawless after years of civil war. </p>  <p> She found the DNA lab well equipped and the technicians well trained. But most police officers do not know how to collect DNA evidence. Even if they did, Angola doesn't have a database of DNA profiles with which to determine the statistical significance of their analyses. These capabilities are crucial in a city that averages as many as 20 sexual assaults, several murders and countless burglaries per day. </p>  <p>&quot;The one day that still makes me cry is the day I helped medical doctors learn how to do rape examinations,&quot; she said.</p><p>Twelve sexual assault victims, the oldest 18 and the youngest 11, were waiting. One was carrying her father's baby. The physician told the young woman she shouldn't file a complaint against her father, however, because he was the family breadwinner.</p>  <p>Even minimal safeguards weren't taken during the physical examination of the victims. &quot;There was no pregnancy information given, no HIV testing, no STD awareness. And the physicians didn't realize they could collect evidence up to five days after the assault.&quot;</p>  <p>She knew then that she'd made the right decision: &quot;I wanted to make Luanda a safer place for victims of sexual assault.&quot;</p>  <p>The country still has many wounds to heal.</p>  <p>&quot;You can still see the scars of this ravaged place,&quot; she said, &quot;windows broken, bullet holes, graffiti as art and the lined faces of those old enough to know the difference between war and peace.</p>  <p>&quot;You see people on the streets selling peanuts, toilet paper - anything they can for just a few kwanza, less than a dollar. And yet, they are grinning ear to ear. They are happy. They don't realize how little they have and are relieved not to be at war. In the United States, we complain if we don't have the latest cell phone - about a lot of things that don't matter.&quot;</p>  <p>The lab technicians she trained &quot;were so motivated to learn and so excited to get a little of the knowledge I have. They didn't realize they already had the knowledge and only needed experience.&quot;</p>  <p>Marshall earned master's degrees in forensic genetics and biochemistry from UNTHSC's Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) in 2002, then launched a career that included four years as a forensic scientist with the Maryland State Police.</p>  <p>In 2008 she returned to the GSBS Forensic and Investigative Genetics Program for a doctorate and as a graduate teaching assistant. &quot;The instructors here are the people who changed genetic forensics technology and are still changing technology,&quot; Marshall says. &quot;Future changes will be based on their research. We are leading the way.&quot;</p>  <p>Inspired by the &quot;family&quot; feel at UNTHSC, she is already giving back by heading the GSBS Alumni Association.</p>  <p>Her major professor told her about the opportunity to work in Angola, and Marshall is glad she chose the more challenging option. Not only did she make a big difference in a dangerous city, but she befriended a team working desperately to make Luanda safer.</p>  <p>&quot;I told them they'll always have my support, they can always contact me, and I will always do what I can do to help them solve crimes and help their country.&quot;</p>    ",,,,,1200,4/11/13 0:00,North Texas Health Forum surfaces obesity issues in Tarrant County,"<p>Statistics show 2.5 million children in the U.S. age 12 to 20 are severely obese, meaning that they weighing more than 100 lbs. over ideal weight.

More than 632 million people worldwide suffer from low back pain, and it is a leading cause of disability. According to the Institute of Medicine, one-third of all Americans suffer from chronic pain, which exceeds the number of people who are affected by heart disease, diabetes and cancer combined.</p>  <p>In the U.S., approximately 100 million adults are affected by chronic pain, and the economic costs of medical care and lost productivity total more than $550 billion annually.</p>  <p>&quot;Chronic low back pain is an important component of these costs,&quot; said John Licciardone, DO, Executive Director of <a href=""../../orc/index.html"">The Osteopathic Research Center</a> at the <a href=""http://unthsc.edu/"">UNT Health Science Center</a> in Fort Worth (UNTHSC) and author of <a href=""http://annfammed.org/content/11/2/122.full"">a study published today in the <em>Annals of Family Medicine</em></a>.<em> </em>&quot;Our research offers hope in the form of a hands-on treatment that provides moderate to substantial improvement in pain, and that reduces the use of prescription medication.&quot;</p>    <p>This study, conducted at UNTHSC used osteopathic manual treatment (OMT) and ultrasound therapy to treat chronic low back pain in 455 adults. Patients in the study who received ultrasound therapy did not see any improvement, but the patients who received OMT saw significant improvement in pain, used less prescription medication and were more satisfied with their care over the 12 weeks of the study than those patients who did not receive OMT.&nbsp;  </p><p>In study patients who received OMT, nearly two-thirds had a 30-percent reduction in their pain&nbsp; level, and half had a 50-percent reduction in their pain level. Patients received six treatments during the course of the study.</p>    <p>&nbsp;&quot;One of the great benefits of OMT is that it has few side effects compared with other common treatments for low back pain that often involve serious side effects,&quot; Licciardone said. &quot;In our study, patients who had higher levels of pain saw even greater reductions in pain. Not only does OMT reduce pain, it seems to work even better in people who experience higher pain levels. These are the people who are often treated with potentially addictive drugs such as OxyContin and Vicodin, epidural steroid injections or surgery.   </p><p>If we can reduce the use of these drugs and invasive procedures by helping people to feel better with hands?on treatment that has few side effects, that is a plus for our patients and contributes to the management of chronic pain.&quot;</p>      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]-->",,,,,1186,4/8/13 0:00,Nobel Prize winner Stanley Prusiner headlines 2013 Research Appreciation Day,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                                     </xml><![endif]-->    <p>&nbsp;UNT Health Science Center will host its 21st annual Research Appreciation Day (RAD) on Friday, April 12, in the Medical Education and Training Building.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=""../../annual/RAD/"">RAD</a> is an institutional tradition encompassing medicine, public health and basic science in a program in which students, faculty and staff share their research efforts with the campus community and the public.

UNT Health Science Center students provide both as they contribute to a healthier community by helping comfort those in need.</p><p>Every week, a dozen students meet at Community Hospice of Texas, which leases space in the James L. West Special Care Center. They visit patients in their rooms and sing hymns in four-part harmony. If the patient and family wish, they join hands and pray.</p><p>The students are part of a choir that creates comforting moments for the patients and their loved ones. &quot;They're especially touched by young people devoting time to this, even if they don't know they're very busy graduate students,&quot; hospice Volunteer Coordinator Judith Pickering said on a recent evening. The dozen-member choir warmed up with The Old Rugged Cross, a patient's special request, before visiting patients' private rooms.</p><p>&quot;That was pretty,&quot; says a 102-year-old patient after hearing her old favorite, &quot;I used to play piano.&quot;</p><p>In a room down the hall, choristers take a moment to pet a miniature dachshund accompanying middle-aged sisters visiting their unconscious mother. When the singers open their hymnals, one of the sisters joins in.</p><p>The choir sings a mini-concert for each patient. Says Pickering, &quot;For the men who feel they must be stoic in the last part of life, the music is an opening to express emotion.&quot;</p><p>The choir was founded a few years ago by students in the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine. Now co-directed by Karen Duong and Whitney Brock, it embraces students from all the UNTHSC schools, plus community members. It's kept organized by the UNTHSC Christian Medical Association and by Community Hospice, whose medical director is Janet Lieto, DO, UNTHSC Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine.</p><p>The students are quick to say they're grateful for the opportunity to serve hospice patients. &quot;It's a learning experience that takes me beyond classwork,&quot; says Whitney Brock. &quot;The rewards are many and priceless.

In any given month, 18 percent of U.S. adults contend with pain in the lower back. </p>    <p>The good news is that the vast majority of low back pain (LBP) incidents clear up in three months. But if it continues, it's designated &quot;chronic.&quot; And if it's <em>your</em> back, you probably have some other choice words for it. </p>    <p>Spine surgery can be beneficial in specific cases that have exhausted more conservative treatment, but many patients who suffer chronic LBP are reluctant to undergo surgery. A non-invasive, far less expensive treatment called osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) alleviates LBP for many patients, and is available through <a href=""http://www.unthealth.org/"">UNT Health</a>. </p>    <p>OMT's guiding principle: The osteopathic physician (DO) uses his or her hands to evaluate and treat the patient by helping the body's skeletal and muscular structures align and balance. &quot;Osteopathic physicians' distinct training makes them particularly adept at diagnosing and treating pain syndromes related to the musculoskeletal system,&quot; says David C. Mason, DO, Chairman of the Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine Department at the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine on the UNT Health Science Center campus.</p>    <p>Because most LBP sufferers' bones and soft tissues (muscles, ligaments, etc.) aren't working together properly, OMT is a natural fit. OMT addresses dysfunctions in musculoskeletal structure and can optimize the body's ability to reduce inflammation and fight infection, as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p>UNT Health has four clinical OMT providers including Mason. He practices OMT, teaches medical students, serves in professional leadership roles and occasionally presents talks in the community. At a recent talk, he explained OMT to an audience of 70 Trinity Terrace retirement-community residents. &quot;I often recommend combining OMT with treatment such as physical therapy, medical pain management and orthopedics,&quot; Mason said. &nbsp;</p>  <p>OMT, a component of sound medical care, is begun after the physician considers the patient's complete history and physical exam. &nbsp;</p>  <p>For 140 years, DOs have made involvement of the patient's mind and spirit, as well as the body, integral to healing. &quot;DOs are trained to listen to their patients,&quot; Mason said. An in-depth conversation about how the patient uses his body is important in diagnosis. &quot;Does the patient spend her workdays at a computer? Lifting heavy boxes? Driving a truck?&quot; Mason said. &quot;A person's occupation and postural habits often determine which muscles and bones work well and which ones hurt.&quot; </p>  <p>To schedule an appointment with a UNT Health Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) provider, please call 817-735-DOCS (3627).</p>      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                                     </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:107%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]-->",,,,,1172,2/26/13 0:00,Medical student saves neighbors from fire,"<table border=""0"" class=""image"" style=""float: right""> <tbody><tr><td><img src=""../../news/upload/Sulak-saves-neighbors.jpg"" alt=""Kyle Sulak saves neighbors"" title=""Kyle Sulak saves neighbors"" /></td></tr> <tr><td class=""caption"" style=""text-align: center"">Kyle Sulak (TCOM '14)</td></tr> </tbody></table>When your neighbor is on fire, there's no time to lose.    <p>Kyle Sulak, a third-year <a href=""../../education/tcom/"" target=""_blank"">Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine</a> student, recently demonstrated the clear judgment and life-saving instincts essential to his future profession.

The race was started by the Board of the Institute for Human Fitness, a division of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine.  I served as the director of the Institute, and invited my running buddy Jim Gilliland to become the race director.  By the week before the race, more than 1,000 runners had signed up, and packet pickup was held in the Atrium of the newly opened Med Ed I, now the Carl Everett Education and Administration Building on the Health Science Center campus.</p><p>&quot;At about 10 p.m. on the Friday before the race, a winter storm called a Blue Norther came through Fort Worth, and the temperature went from a pleasant 70 degrees to the mid-20s by daylight. The course was covered in thick, white ice.  Because of the ice, the official in charge of course marking, Paul Isham, former city attorney of Fort Worth, scoured all the 24-hour K-Mart stores, bought up all the cans of spray paint he could find, and had the course remarked. He was able to get to the starting line and run the marathon himself.  He ran with Dick Armey, then a professor at UNT, who would later become the House Majority Leader in the US Congress. I'll never forget the image of the two of them coming across the finish line through the ice and snow.</p><p>&quot;That first year, I was the finish line marshal and called out the winners' names as they crossed the finish line. I think the most rewarding part of the race is that feeling of accomplishment and self-satisfaction that a runner feels when he or she crosses the finish line. It's something that they hold onto and cherish.</p><p>&quot;While the Institute and the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine were the original sponsors, they were joined that first year by the Fort Worth National Bank (now Chase Bank). The bank's president was Jody Grant, a running buddy of Dr. Joel Alter, Professor of Surgery at TCOM, who invited the bank to join TCOM as a sponsor.  The following year, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the Miller Brewing Company joined as sponsors, and the race was off and running.</p><p>&quot;The Cowtown has gone from a race among a close-knit group of running enthusiasts to Forth Worth's  top running event and the largest multi-race event in Texas.&quot;</p>",,,,,1167,2/20/13 0:00,Pollen counts are at record highs: Use these tips to cope with allergies,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                             </xml><![endif]--><p>Daily pollen counts in the Fort Worth area are setting records, and for some, that means sniffles, sneezing and itchy eyes.</p>    <p>John Fling, MD, UNTHSC Professor of Pediatrics, who practices Allergy/Immunology for adults and children, said the record pollen levels have been growing for a couple of years.</p>    <p>&quot;We've had mild winters for the last two years,&quot; he said, &quot;and that has caused plants to pollinate earlier and at higher volumes.&quot; </p>    <p>Mountain cedar pollens are creating misery for many at the moment, he said. </p>    <p>&quot;In Central Texas, they call it &lsquo;cedar fever,'&quot; Fling said. &quot;They have much more mountain cedar pollen there than we do here. It's a significant health risk.&quot; In fact, the City of Albuquerque, NM bans the planting of certain cedar trees as part of the &quot;Albuquerque Pollen Control Ordinance&quot; passed in 1994.</p>    <p>How best to cope if you are a pollen allergy sufferer? Fling recommends avoiding the pollens by staying indoors as much as possible. If that's not realistic, over-the-counter antihistamines can help. There are choices available that aren't as likely to cause drowsiness as a side effect, and antihistamine eye drops also are available.&nbsp;  </p><p>Fling said the pollens also can trigger an inflammatory response, which can be prevented by using a prescription nasal spray containing a steroid. Fling reminds that you need to start using the spray before the allergy season strikes for it to be effective.</p>    <p>&quot;And if all else fails, there is always allergy desensitization,&quot; Fling said, which involves injections of small amounts of the allergen to help the body grow accustom to and tolerate it. &quot;The injections work well and provide long-lasting benefits, but they are inconvenient because they have to be administered in a physician's office in case of a reaction. It takes some months before allergy shots begin to work, and you will need to stay on them for a minimum of three to five years.&quot;&nbsp;  </p><p><strong>Tips for coping with allergies</strong></p>  <ul class=""unIndentedList""><li> Try to stay inside with doors and windows shut as much a possible</li><li> Use over-the-counter antihistamine pills and eye drops</li><li> Over-the-counter decongestants can help with stuffiness</li><li> If needed, ask your physician about a steroid nasal spray</li><li> In the case of severe allergies, consider visiting an allergist for allergy desensitization injections</li></ul>          <p><em>John Fling is board certified in pediatrics and allergy/immunology.

But even the brightest students may not be ready for the rigor required.  The Master of Science in Medical Sciences (Med Sci) degree offered in  the <a href=""../../education/gsbs/"">Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> boosts students' strengths so  they can succeed.  </p><p>While similar programs at other universities  typically offer only a certificate, UNTHSC's Med Sci program awards a  master's degree - after just one year of intensive study. And the  results are outstanding. Since the program's inception in 1999, 73  percent of graduates have been accepted into medical school. Among  graduates with a grade-point average of 3.5 or higher, the figure is  nearly 100 percent. </p><p>In addition, some graduates enter other advanced health-care fields such as dentistry and physician assistancy.   </p><p>The  UNTHSC Med Sci program's coursework in structural anatomy also sets it  apart from most other universities, said Patricia Gwirtz, PhD, Assistant  Dean, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and Med Sci program  director. </p><p>&quot;Students enter the program to improve their  application package for medical school, but we accept them only if they  already have a competitive score on the Medical College Admission Test,&quot;  Gwirtz said. &quot;If they can handle this level of work and earn a master's  in one hectic year, they can excel in medical school.&quot;  </p><p>&quot;The  goal is to give students the chance to build on their bachelor's degree  in science, with an eye toward their successful completion of medical  school,&quot; said Jamboor Vishwanatha, PhD, Dean of the Graduate School of  Biomedical Sciences. </p><p>The experience of Med Sci grad Kristen  Taylor McCormick is typical. A few years ago when her medical school  applications were rejected, she feared that her dream of becoming a  physician was slipping away. &quot;I was devastated,&quot; she recalled.  </p><p>Her  solution was the UNTHSC Med Sci program. Though she found it  challenging, she achieved her dream. &quot;I expected it to be like  undergraduate school, but it wasn't -- it was like medical school. We  were asked to jump through a hoop of fire.&quot;  </p><p>Now a fourth-year student  at UNTHSC's <a href=""../../education/tcom/"">Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine</a>, McCormick has high  praise for Med Sci. &quot;It helps transition students from the life of an  undergraduate filled with extracurricular activities such as football  games and parties, to a life completely focused on their studies,&quot; she  said. &quot;They learn to study massive amounts of material.   Extracurricular activities here tend to support the curriculum and are  directly related to the student's career.&quot; </p><p>Med Sci graduates  proceed to study medicine at prestigious universities. In 2011, 56  percent of those who opted to study medicine in Texas were accepted by  TCOM. Additional medical schools where Med Sci graduates are studying  include UT-Southwestern, UT-Medical Branch, UT-Houston, UT-San Antonio,  A.T. Still-Arizona and Baylor Dental. </p><p>    Learn more at the <a href=""../../Education/gsbs/medicalsciences.cfm"">UNTHSC Med Sci website</a>.  </p> ",,,,,1161,2/12/13 0:00,Protect the hearts you love with these heart health tips,"<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/2RB_rPgYWps?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Locating a station on campus not only provides convenience to our faculty, staff and students but also brings more people to our campus and continues the UNTHSC commitment to major community projects.&quot; </p><p>Fort Worth's Bike Sharing program launch is tentatively set for April 22 and will include the unveiling of the 22-bike UNTHSC station outside the Center for BioHealth near the intersection of Camp Bowie Boulevard and Boland Street. Other station locations will be downtown, the Cultural District, the Near Southside and at TCU. UNTHSC will be the westernmost station at program launch, and about half of the bikes installed there at program launch will bear the UNTHSC logo. </p><p>The sponsorship costs for the station have been funded through the cooperation of multiple UNTHSC departments including: Facilities Management Department, Office of Sustainability, Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, School of Public Health, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, School of Health Professions, Employee Benefits Action Committee and the Fund for Excellence, which is supported largely by contributions to the annual employee giving campaign.  </p><p>As a station sponsor, UNTHSC employees and students will have the option to purchase discounted Bike Share passes.  </p><p>Connect with Fort Worth Bike Share: </p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.fortworthbikesharing.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fortworthbikesharing.org/</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/FortWorthBikeSharing"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/FortWorthBikeSharing</a></li><li><a href=""https://twitter.com/fwbikesharing"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/fwbikesharing </a></li></ul><p><a href=""http://www.bikesbelong.org/resources/stats-and-research/research/bike-sharing-in-the-united-states/"" target=""_blank"">Click here for more information on bike sharing in the U.S.   </a></p>",,,,,1157,2/2/13 0:00,Join UNTHSC at the TOMA Midwinter Conference,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>        </xml><![endif]-->    <p>Attending The <a href=""http://www.txosteo.org/"" target=""_blank"">Texas Osteopathic Medical Association Midwinter Conference</a> this weekend in Dallas?

They're available for purchase via an online auction benefiting <a href=""http://www.alz.org/oc/in_my_community_10849.asp"" target=""_blank"">Memories  in the Making</a>.  </p><p>The exhibit, &quot;Heart, Mind, Hand:  Paintings by People with Dementia,&quot; is free and open to the public  through February. You'll find it on the south and east walls of Floor 2  in the Everett building, 3500 Camp Bowie Blvd. </p><p>Each  title placard includes a QR code for bidding, and the artist's first  name and remarks. One of the artists is Edward, a gentle man who doesn't  speak much anymore. His wife is dead and he has no children. His  painting is an abstract cloud of complementary colors with a blank white  space in the center. He titled it That's Me.  </p><p> Dementia research  and geriatrics are among UNTHSC's greatest strengths.  &quot;There's a huge  need to know more about dementias,&quot; said Buck. &quot;The Health Science  Center does such great work in that area,&quot; Buck said. &quot;I hope the  researchers will view these paintings and provide insight on what's  going on in these people's brains when they paint.&quot;  </p><p>One  of the artists, Mildred, painted bold, vertical brushstrokes in greens,  yellows and fuchsia and titled it Colored Storm.  She said, &quot;Maybe I  have a little talent.  I never painted anything in my life and now  they're telling me it's good.&quot; </p><p><strong>Rockport 9 exhibit on Atrium first floor<br /></strong></p><p>Texas landscapes and  scenes come alive in an exhibit by the Rockport 9 on the Atrium  Gallery's first floor.

TCOM is one of few medical schools that formally helps medical educators refine their teaching skills, and the Academy is one of the most rigorous. </p>    <p>According to Associate Dean, Curricular Design and Faculty Development Frank Papa, PhD, who leads the Academy, &quot;Few if any other medical schools have an academy this ambitious. Most are not as outcomes-oriented. If we continue this approach, we will be one of the first medical schools with a true 21<sup>st</sup> century curriculum among all osteopathic medical schools, if not all U.S. or European medical schools.&quot;</p>    <p>AME enriches TCOM's already innovative approach, referred to as a &quot;problem and task-focused curriculum,&quot; in which students use class time to address patient case studies rather than passively listening to lectures. TCOM students develop clinically relevant skills, and as a result, they consistently score the highest in the nation on osteopathic medicine licensing exams. The academy's goal is to continually refine TCOM's innovative curriculum, Papa said.</p>    <p>&quot;We help faculty to understand current learning sciences principles and then apply them in the development of instructional modules congruent with those principles,&quot; Papa said. </p>    <p>AME also prepares faculty to advance as clinician educators, and it helps them develop education-oriented research skills that can improve medical education even further. The academy offers graduate-level course work that leads to a formal certificate in Higher Education. The approximately 30 AME participants meet four hours per week and are exempted from a component of their patient-care responsibilities so they have time to focus on curricular design and implementation, self-study and educational research.</p>        <p>Simply put, &quot;we have consciously and carefully departed from traditional approaches to medical education and are now 12 years into the development of a learning-sciences based medical curriculum,&quot; Papa said. &quot;In another 10 years we will be nationally and internationally recognized as the authors of one of the first, learning sciences-based medical curricular models. This approach to medical education will improve both the competencies of medical students and the care they provide their patients.&quot; </p>    <p>He noted that TCOM's approach to differential diagnosis assumes that most human diseases lack sufficient signs and symptoms for a physician to make a reliably accurate diagnosis at the bedside. </p>    <p>&quot;Therefore, differential diagnosis is a high-stakes game of imprecision,&quot; Papa said. &quot;How can you try to be certain when both the diseases, and, the knowledge base and processes underlying differential diagnosis, are ill-defined? Given the inevitability of diagnostic errors, we are trying to reduce the amount of necessary fallibility associated with medical care in general and differential diagnosis in particular.

But last summer, the UNT Health Science Center began an Executives in Residence program giving entrepreneurs access to advice from industry experts as their companies navigate the challenges of developing and commercializing new products. At the core of the program, is a seasoned executive team of successful life science professionals who provide board-level guidance in managing the critical early stages of pharmaceutical and medical device product development.</p>    <p>&quot;This is a wonderful resource and ad hoc advisory board that helps independent researchers connect to potential partners and funding entities,&quot; said Michael Bartlett, president and CEO of Vital Arts &amp; Science. &quot;Many people don't realize how small start-ups struggle to develop relationships with big pharmaceutical companies. This service helps provide that guidance and support.&quot;</p>    <p>Currently, 12 clients from North Texas to Atlanta to Boston are part of the program, believed to be the only one of its kind in the U.S. The number and caliber of the UNTHSC Executives in Residence makes the program unique as most incubators do not have dedicated health care executives on staff. Unlike traditional incubators, the UNTHSC Executives in Residence program is a simple fee-based service so clients never give up any equity. &nbsp;Companies and individuals can receive the guidance they need from one or all of the corporate executives in areas such as preclinical studies, clinical trials, regulatory pathways, marketing, business development, strategic planning, licensing and acquisitions. Clients also benefit from the large number of industry contacts the team has. In addition to the executive team, the Executives in Residence program includes access to office and laboratory workspaces, use of business equipment and conference room privileges.</p>    <p>&quot;Over the years, we have come to realize the need for our partner companies to access high-level advice from experts at the earliest stages. Our executive team has more than 150 years of real-world experience in licensing, developing and launching pharmaceutical products,&quot; explained Robert McClain, PhD, Associate Vice President of Research at UNTHSC, who helped establish the executive team and program through UNTHSC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style> <![endif]-->",,,,,1143,1/18/13 0:00,Check out the latest issue of North Texas Health & Science magazine,"<p>    The latest issue of <em>North Texas Health &amp; Science</em> is now online.

But when it's in the cause of helping a young person choose a lifetime career, it's an entirely different story.</p>    <p>It's called shadowing, and it's the central component of a program by the UNT Career Center called &quot;Take Flight.&quot; The idea is to help current UNT undergraduates identify their intended future profession in medical or allied health professions, then shadow a mentor within that field. </p>    <p>Earlier in January, the UNT Health Science Center approached the program from a different angle, welcoming pre-medical and pre-health profession students from the University of North Texas as well as Texas Christian University to campus so they could experience two days in the life of medical and health professions students, faculty and staff - shadowing the institution at several levels, rather than one profession. Participants met with panels of current Health Science Center students and admissions personnel of the <a href=""http://unthsc.edu/education/tcom/"">Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine (TCOM)</a> and School of Health Professions' <a href=""http://unthsc.edu/education/PASP/"">Physician Assistant (PA) Studies</a> and <a href=""http://unthsc.edu/departments/PhysicalTherapy/"">Physical Therapy (PT)</a> programs.

She's interested in becoming a DO and wanted to know more about TCOM. &nbsp;</p>    <p>Kristi Dena, a senior biology major from TCU, works as a medical scribe in the emergency room at Texas Health Harris Methodist, and became interested in the PA program at the Health Science Center after meeting many of the students during rotations. &quot;This experience has helped me learn so much about the admissions process,&quot; Dena said. &quot;It has confirmed that UNTHSC is my first choice.&quot;</p>    <p>Maribel Lomeli, a junior kinesiology major from TCU interested in physical therapy, said her favorite part of the two-day experience was touring the anatomy lab. &quot;It showed me the difference between undergraduate and graduate studies. I saw the next step,&quot; she said. &quot;I can't wait to do that.&quot;</p>    <p>A pre-medical student also interested in public health met with a current School of Public Health student and many others visiting were made aware of the Master of Medical Sciences program in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

It's a 30-year-old conflict that's cost an estimated 35 million lives. The invader is HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, the cause of AIDS. First reported in 1981, the tiny virus continues to take a giant toll, with an average of more than 2 million new cases reported each year. </p>    <p>Final victory against HIV is still a long way off. But innovative treatment approaches are creating increasingly viable alternatives to what was once a death sentence.</p>    <p><img src=""../../news/upload/Patrick%20Clay%20web.jpg"" alt=""Patrick Clay"" hspace=""5"" vspace=""5"" width=""159"" height=""245"" align=""right"" />Such an approach appears in the first peer-reviewed paper to come from the new UNT System <a href=""http://www.unthsc.edu/education/SCP/"">College of Pharmacy</a> (UNTSCP) at Fort Worth's UNT Health Science Center. In the publication, author Patrick G. Clay, PharmD, FCCP, CCTI and Professor of Pharmacotherapy, discusses the mechanics of HIV and the study's innovative strategy to defeat the virus.</p>    <p><strong>Q: Can you briefly summarize where we stand in the battle against HIV and AIDS?</strong></p>    <p>A: Scientists have made amazing strides against HIV. But there are two key elements to understanding this battle. First, regardless of how perfectly a person takes their medicine and treats their body, the virus eventually develops resistance and the drugs no longer work. Second, sometimes patients are infected with a virus strain that doesn't respond to even the newest and most potent drugs. </p>    <p><strong>Q: What makes the HIV virus so deadly?</strong></p>    <p>A: Let's make this really simple. Human T-cells or CD4 cells are our body's &quot;soldiers.&quot; They're responsible for keeping &quot;invaders&quot; or foreign substances like bacteria, fungi and viruses, from making us sick. CD4s normally live about 8 weeks. HIV shortens that to less than 3 days. The body can keep producing new T-cells for up to 5 years on average but then can't anymore. When this happens, the immune system begins to fail. </p>    <p><strong>Q: How do today's pharmaceuticals fight the virus?</strong></p>    <p>A: There are nearly 30 anti-HIV drugs that fight the virus in different ways, but for simplicity's sake, they can be grouped into two main categories: they help prevent the virus from using T-cells to make more copies of itself, or they don't allow the virus to leave the T-cell and infect other cells. The key thing is they have to be used in combination with 3 or 4 other drugs at the same time. Otherwise, the virus figures out ways to beat the drugs. </p>    <p><strong>Q: So if all this is going on to prevent HIV from replicating, how is it that the virus is still such a problem? </strong></p>    <p>A: The main issue is that the above-mentioned combination therapy only keeps the virus from copying itself to produce more new viruses. The medicines cannot eliminate the virus. This is because the virus' genetic material has become part of the T-cells' DNA. At any time, the virus is &quot;hiding&quot; in the T-cell DNA and can emerge again. Another reason it may re-appear is because the medicines were stopped or the virus figured out a way to make copies of itself even though the medicine was present. </p>    <p>Another issue entirely is that the drugs do not get into all the places the virus can hide - like the brain. The virus replicates unchecked there.</p>    <p><strong>Q: What is the innovative approach that you write about?</strong></p>    <p>A: Some time ago, scientists at the University of Washington took a different approach to the battle. Instead of trying to stop the virus from making copies of itself, what if a drug was created that fooled the virus into making changes to its special proteins when it didn't need to? What if the virus would make so many changes that it could no longer make copies of itself without realizing it? Is this possible? It might be. &nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Q: How does this approach work?</strong></p>    <p>A: The approach is called viral decay acceleration. Basically, it means the virus changes, or mutates, its special proteins so much that it can no longer function. KP-1461 is the chemical that may just make this happen. Unfortunately, the research is stalled right now, primarily due to the economic slowdown, which forced researchers to stop the study.</p>    <p><strong>Q: What was your role in this process?</strong></p>    <p>A: My part was to advise on how to design the trial and to serve as lead author for the Phase 1 study and second author on the Phase 2 study publication. The drug made it through Phase 1 testing and entered Phase 2 and is reflected in this peer-reviewed document. Clearly, the concept is promising, but much more work needs to be done.</p>    <p><strong>Q: How would you propose to revive the process? </strong></p><p>    A: There are some unique characteristics of this chemical that are potential game changers in HIV therapy. These need to be explored to make sure that when we begin testing this drug in people again, we get the best possible answers. To do this takes financing, in the form of venture capital money. When that happens, we can resume the work and perhaps - perhaps - come up with a novel approach to defeating, or at least slowing down, HIV.    </p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,1137,1/10/13 0:00,Trauma survivors find relief in yoga,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>        800x600   </xml><![endif]-->  <p>Quick: think about a psychologist's office. What do you see? Probably a couch, tissue boxes and giant books with indecipherable names. But yoga mats?&nbsp;  </p><p>If it's the office of UNT Health's Mandy Jordan, PhD, you bet. </p>    <p>Patients who experience or witness life-threatening events, such as sexual or physical assault, war, or a serious accident, can exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These symptoms may include hypervigilance, frequent distressing memories or nightmares of the trauma, or startling easily. &quot;This constant state of stress has a significant impact on the brain and body,&quot; Jordan said.&nbsp;  </p><p>Traditional talk therapies, such as exposure therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy, may actually re-traumatize patients if they do not have adequate emotional coping skills, she said. &quot;Trauma-sensitive yoga can help heal areas of the brain that were impacted by the trauma, such as the limbic system (part of the brain that activates the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response), and thus individuals can better regulate and tolerate their emotions, which aids the healing process.&quot; </p>    <p>Recent research bears out her belief. In a study published last year in the <em>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</em>, patients with histories of trauma, who practiced trauma-sensitive yoga as part of their therapy, showed significantly more improvement in symptoms than those who just participated in group therapy sessions.</p>    <p>Trauma-sensitive yoga differs from traditional yoga. Bessel van der Kolk and colleagues, at The Trauma Center at Justice Resource Institute, in Boston, Mass., have developed a specific type of yoga tailored for individuals who have experienced trauma. For example, participants are provided with choices on how they could move their bodies rather than being told what to do, which can remind them of their trauma. It is also gentle and slow and focuses on becoming comfortable with and connected to their bodies, and on regulating uncomfortable emotions and breathing.&nbsp;  </p><p>Thus far, research indicates trauma-sensitive yoga helps reduce symptoms of PTSD when used in conjunction with psychotherapy. After several sessions of trauma-sensitive yoga, clients are better able to tolerate and regulate uncomfortable emotions and physical sensations, rather than panicking or shutting down, which allows them to process the trauma during traditional talk therapy. Other areas of improvement include better decision making, maintaining presence, and gaining introspection.&nbsp; </p>    Dr. Jordan's trauma-sensitive yoga group, for women, occurs from 3 to 4 p.m. on Tuesdays. A program for men is under consideration.

Getting together with friends, walking or going to the local senior center helps older individuals stay healthy. Nicoleta Bugnariu, PhD, Associate Professor of Physical Therapy, and Rita Patterson, PhD, Professor of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine, both on faculty at the UNT Health Science Center, offer these tips to prevent a fall in icy weather:</p>  <ol><li>Be cautious walking on sidewalks and in public places, and entering or exiting your car, especially if it's covered with ice or snow. Even when surfaces do not look especially icy or slippery, a thin sheet of transparent ice can put you at risk for slipping.</li><li>Avoid wearing high-heeled shoes or boots outside. Wear flat shoes with slip-resistant soles or rain/snow boots that provide traction.&nbsp;</li><li>Concentrate on your path.&nbsp; Walk with your knees slightly bent, feet widely apart, arms held out to your sides and take slow, short, flat steps. The heels and soles of your shoes should stay in contact with the ground as long as possible, providing you with maximum surface contact.&nbsp; Don't carry heavy items, and grip a handrail if possible.</li><li>Use sidewalks whenever possible. If there is no sidewalk and the street is clear, walk against the flow of traffic, and stay close to the curb. Don't walk in the streets! Remember,&nbsp;cars&nbsp;and&nbsp;trucks&nbsp;slip and slide, too!&nbsp; If you can't avoid the street, wear bright or reflective clothing.&nbsp;</li><li>Wear clothing that does not restrict your vision. Stay warm, but&nbsp;don't<strong> </strong>restrict your vision with hoodies, ski masks, scarves, hats, etc.</li><li>Ice can hide under a light dusting of snow. Just because you don't see the ice doesn't mean it's not there.&nbsp;</li><li>Be aware of&nbsp;overhead hazards! Falling icicles and chunks of ice kill hundreds of people each year. Icicles can grow quickly. Their size and dagger-like formation are extremely dangerous for pedestrians.</li><li>Remove your shoes or boots once you get inside. Snow and ice often stick to the soles of shoes and will melt almost immediately as your shoes begin to warm up. The result is a slippery surface and the risk of a fall.</li><li>If you feel yourself falling backward, tuck in your chin to protect your head as much as possible and try to roll with the fall. If you feel yourself falling forward, avoid the urge to use your arms to break your fall-you may do more harm to your body than good.</li><li>If you fall, try to land on a part of your body with more padding, such as your buttocks.       </li></ol>",,,,,1135,1/4/13 0:00,UNTHSC blood drive a success,"<p><img src=""../../news/upload/Blood%20Drive%20Instagram.jpg"" alt=""Blood Drive"" title=""Blood Drive"" width=""250"" height=""250"" align=""right"" /></p><p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> More than 40 units of blood were collected at the drive, potentially saving more than 120 lives.

The working group, STandards for Alzheimer's Research in Blood biomarkers&nbsp;(STAR-B), represents the first initiative for creating global standards for blood collection in Alzheimer's analysis. </p>  <p>In addition, the collaborators are working to&nbsp;establish consensus on the data that must be presented in published work to ensure the ability to cross-validate results.&nbsp;</p>  <p>While international standard protocols for spinal puncture and brain&nbsp;MRI in Alzheimer's research are either available or very far in their progress, no such protocols exist for drawing blood, handling blood samples or assaying blood samples relating to Alzheimer's research.

But when a loved one has dementia, there are additional things to consider: </p><ul><li><strong>Remember the most important aspect of the holidays - people!</strong><br />Don't get so caught up in maintaining traditions that those important relationships get lost. Keep the traditions your loved one has enjoyed in the past and would enjoy now. Plan activities focused on spending time with your loved one, not on getting a lot done.  </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Plan activities, adapting the scale if needed</strong><br />Plan an hour or two to spend with your loved one doing activities you both enjoy but are not overwhelming. If your loved one enjoyed shopping, try going to a specialty store instead of a busy mall, and avoid the stores' peak times. If your loved one enjoys crowds and activity, go to the mall for a cup of coffee to look at the decorations and people, not for a major shopping trip. Again, try to avoid busy shopping times.  </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Tailor traditions to your loved ones' abilities</strong><br />If baking is a favorite activity, let them help with tasks they can handle. If they can still chop, measure and mix, encourage them to do so. If not, perhaps ask them to decorate the baked goods.<br /><br />If your loved ones enjoy sending holiday cards, ask them to help pick out the cards and address the envelopes if they are able.&nbsp; Or simply share cards that have been received and reminisce about the sender.</li></ul>    <ul><li><strong>Create a comfortable environment</strong><br />If your loved ones are visiting you, designate a &quot;quiet room&quot; where they can get a break from the &quot;busy-ness&quot; and overstimulation the holidays can deliver. Try to keep to the schedule your loved one maintains at home. Eating and sleeping at about the same times each day helps them avoid the holiday &quot;crash.&quot;    </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Give yourself permission not to include your loved one in all activities</strong><br />Many events are too over-stimulating to be fully enjoyed by someone who is suffering from dementia.     </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Be ready to adapt</strong><br />Keep the activity light and positive. If you notice your loved ones are showing signs of stress, redirect them, take a break or move to a new activity. Your loved one will relate to feelings of joy and companionship in a friendly, supportive atmosphere more than to any specific activity.    </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Allow time for yourself</strong><br />You and your loved one both will be more relaxed if you allow time for yourself as well. You will better enjoy the thoughtful and carefully planned time you spend together.  </li></ul><p>To make an appointment for those with dementia, Alzheimer's disease or age-related issues, contact <a href=""http://unthealth.org/contact.aspx"">UNT Health</a> at 817-735-DOCS (3637). </p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>      <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style> <![endif]-->",,,,,1129,12/18/12 0:00,New UNTHSC billboards are going up around Fort Worth,"<p>  <table border=""0"" class=""image""> <tbody><tr><td><img src=""../../news/upload/billboard-crop.jpg"" alt=""UNTHSC Billboard"" title=""UNTHSC Billboard"" /></td></tr> <tr><td class=""caption"">The new UNTHSC billboard at I-30 eastbound at Beach St.</td></tr> </tbody></table>  </p><p>The advertising campaign features <a href=""http://www.unthealth.org"" target=""_blank"">UNT Health</a> providers Janice Knebl, DO; Sharon Gustowski, DO; and Madge Barnes, MD. </p><p>You will soon see the new boards in five locations around Fort Worth: the corner of Camp Bowie and Montgomery; I-35W southbound at 33rd; I-35W northbound at Hattie; 121 Airport Freeway eastbound at Minnis; and I-30 eastbound at Beach.    </p>",,,,,1128,12/12/12 0:00,UNTHSC holiday closing schedule,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>        </xml><![endif]-->  <p><img src=""../../news/upload/EAD%20-%20July%202011.jpg"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""166"" align=""right"" />The UNT Health Science Center will be closed Monday, Dec. 24, through Tuesday, Jan. 1, for the <a href=""https://www.unthsc.edu/calendar/holidays.cfm"" target=""_blank"">winter holiday</a>.

All that stress can take a physical toll on us as chemicals in the brain-- specifically cortisol-- are released during stressful times. However, if you add in the expectation that we should always be plugged into technology, the stress levels can skyrocket.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> The more important all these things are to you, the more pressure you feel.<br /> <br /> Blood pressure already stressed can climb further as we are continuously assaulted by emails, texts and calls. Our bodies can actually experience stress similar to traumatic stress disorder, causing irritable bowel syndrome, heart problems, hypertension, fatigue, insomnia, type II diabetes and obesity. <br /> <br /> As Vicki Nejtek, PhD, <a href=""http://unthsc.edu/"">UNT Health Science Center</a> Associate Professor of<a href=""../../departments/psychiatry/"" target=""_blank""> Psychiatry and Behavioral Health</a>, puts it, &quot;If folks perceive the constant barrage of cell phone calls, text messages, pager beeps and emails as inconvenient interruptions, then they may be likely to become stressed out and irritated. The more irritated you become, the more cortisol is released. The more cortisol is released, the higher the likelihood that the irritability will escalate to anger. If this cycle continues, you have a higher-than-average risk of developing health problems.&quot;<br /> <br /> To protect your mind and body, you need downtime. To help, Nejtek has proposed a new program called &quot;<strong>Shut It Down</strong>,&quot; this holiday season. For one week, Nejtek says to put away all non-emergency technology for one hour per day and disengage from technology to reconnect with reality. &quot;Yes, stash that iPhone in a drawer, or just turn it off to practice the mindfulness of living in the moment and renewing your mind, body and spirit. You may discover that disconnecting from technology is a very healthy practice with great benefits.

In general, lighter-colored drinks like white wine or vodka tend to cause fewer hangover effects than darker beverages.</li><li> Avoid mixing different types of alcohol.</li><li> Keep count of the number of drinks you've had, and pace yourself to no more than one drink per hour.</li><li> Alternate alcoholic with non-alcoholic beverages to space out the effects, and drink plenty of water. It also helps to put extra ice in your drink.</li><li> Set a drinking limit ahead of time, before you start. </li><li> Ask a friend to let you know when you've had enough, and stay with people you know.</li><li> Be aware of any potential interactions between alcohol and medications you might be taking.</li><li> Caffeinated beverages don't sober up someone who is drunk ... although they can dangerously give the impression that a person is more sober and able to drive.</li><li> Eat a meal before going out - if you have been eating, it takes longer for alcohol to be absorbed into the bloodstream.</li><li> Stay with friends who might have had too much to drink - don't assume it's safe for them to be alone to &quot;sleep it off.&quot;</li><li> Remember - any amount of alcohol consumption before driving can impact your abilities behind the wheel. Make sure to plan ahead for a sober way home. This could include setting up a designated driver in advance, or keeping the number of a taxi service in your phone contacts list. If someone you know has been drinking, help them find a sober way home as well.</li><li> Avoid shots and drinking games.</li></ul>                        <p>Students are known for using alcohol to get through and celebrate the end of the school semester, so UNT Health Science Center students are practicing &quot;Drink Responsibly Week&quot; from Dec. 3-7.

The 354 strands of lights total the length of 20 football fields but they're 85 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents. A traditional bulb is 0.5 watts, but an LED just 0.069 watts, McHugh said. It will cost $46 to operate the tree lights for 45 days, versus $334 if they were incandescent, he said. </p>  <p>The Health Science Center is going green, and not just for Christmas. The recently created Office of <a href=""../../departments/sustainability/default.cfm"" target=""_blank"">Sustainability</a> is giving free reusable water bottles to all UNTHSC faculty, staff and students who take an online Sustainability Pledge. The pledge encourages the UNTHSC community to take actions to enhance our sustainability efforts such as lowering energy and water consumption. (Did you know that Americans throw away -- not recycle -- about 2.6 billion 1-liter plastic water bottles each year, according to the Container Recycling Institute?) </p>      <p>In less than three weeks more than 550 people have taken the Pledge, and more are signing on every day, said Sustainability Coordinator Sandy Bauman, MS, MPA. </p>  <p>The water bottles can be refilled anywhere, including water-bottle &quot;filling stations&quot; recently installed in several campus buildings. The stations fill the 20-ounce bottle in about seven seconds and also are equipped as conventional drinking fountains. </p>      <p>The water is filtered for better taste and activated by a touchless sensor, supporting good hygiene since hands don't touch the surfaces. A digital meter shows how many plastic bottles have been spared at each station. </p>  <p>UNTHSC has been getting steadily greener for years. The Medical Education and Training (MET) Building, opened in 2010, is <strong><a href=""https://new.usgbc.org/leed"" target=""_blank"">LEED</a> </strong>Gold. Compared to a similar building of the same size that's not LEED, the MET saves about 250,000 gallons of water and $55,000 in energy costs per year. </p>      <p>In 2011 the UNTHSC campus recycled 233 tons of cardboard, paper, plastic, aluminum and glass, saving nearly 3,000 mature trees and enough electricity to power more than 80 homes for a year. Buildings' retrofits, such as installation of new energy-saving windows, have saved the equivalent of 59,000 trees and 241,000 gallons of gasoline, with an investment of $8.6 million that will pay for itself in about 10 years. </p>  <p>Additionally, construction is under way on a new two-acre Library Courtyard with a conservation-minded water feature and more than 100 new trees. The height of the fountains on the &quot;splash block&quot; can be adjusted for the weather.&nbsp; The project is scheduled to be complete in spring 2013.</p>      <p>To make way for the courtyard, two obsolete buildings were removed. Seventy-five percent of the demolition debris was recycled, including concrete, asphalt, copper, steel, tin and wire. </p>  <p>Additional sustainability initiatives under development on campus include: </p>  <ul class=""unIndentedList""><li> &quot;Green&quot; office certification </li><li> Earth Day event for April 2013 </li><li> Feasibility study on participation in STARS (Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System) sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.

UNTHSC's <a href=""../../education/SPH/"">School of Public Health</a> is the first in Texas to offer an accelerated online <a href=""../../education/sph/MPH_PO.cfm"">Master of Public Health Professional Option</a>. You can complete a course in just eight weeks instead of the usual 16.</p>    <p>Matt Nolan Adrignola, EdD, MBA, SPH Associate Dean of Administration &amp; Student Services and Assistant Professor of Public Health Education, said the eight-week option has been well received by students and faculty alike. Typical is Lesley Wheeler, Research Coordinator at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children in Dallas, who recently completed the Professional Option's debut course, Biostatistics.</p>    <p><strong>Combining career and coursework<br /></strong>&quot;I could only take night classes with my work schedule, so the online classes are much preferred,&quot; Wheeler said. &quot;I want to work while I continue my education, and this has been a great experience.&quot;</p>      <p>Wheeler's research focuses on better ways to help newborns and children with limb deformities and injuries, and preventing those problems as well. &quot;I have already seen the direct benefits of this class in my current occupation, as I have been running statistics for some of my studies,&quot; she said.&nbsp; </p>  <p>By summer, SPH expects all its core courses to be available online, and by 2015, all Professional Option courses. SPH also is developing a library of online lectures.</p>      <p>Working adult students can concentrate on one class at a time, or take two eight-week classes in the traditional 16-week semester, thus accelerating their progress. Faculty can concentrate on their course for eight weeks, then spend the rest of the semester on grant or contract projects and publishing efforts. </p>  <p>The face-to-face option is still offered in the traditional 16-week classroom semester, although &quot;the set-up of accelerated online Biostatistics felt very much like a traditional classroom,&quot; Wheeler said. &quot;I listened to lectures and discussed problems with classmates and the teaching assistants.&quot;</p>      <p>She described communication with her professor, Subhash Aryal, PhD, Assistant Professor of Biostatistics, as efficient and helpful: &quot;I appreciated the commitment to &lsquo;office hours,' which allowed the students to engage with the professor in real time versus merely through email.&quot; </p>  <p><strong>Going greener and more convenient</strong><br />Students praised the class' convenience. Said Wheeler, &quot;Although there were deadlines and due dates, I did not have to abide by a rigid class schedule. This allowed me to work full-time and complete homework on my time.&quot; </p>  <p>Students also appreciated having no traffic hassles, saving gasoline money and reducing emissions. It's another way the <a href=""../..//"">UNT Health Science Center</a> creates solutions for a healthier community.</p>      <p>Wheeler described how she chose the Health Science Center. &quot;I had been doing research on graduate schools in the area.

At times she couldn't breathe. Playing basketball was out of the question. Her team was on track to make the playoffs - without her. Yurvati, the 13th physician she'd seen, discovered an injury to the xiphoid process at the base of her sternum. </p>    <p>What caused it to happen? A freak injury. Kylie had been running cross country when she was struck by a car. She knew a rib was fractured but didn't know why the pain continued after the rib healed. Thus began the journey to physician after physician until she found Yurvati. </p>    <p>&quot;It was the first thing I thought of,&quot; he said. &quot;It was pressing on the sac enclosing her heart. That's why she couldn't breathe and why it was so painful.&quot;</p>    <p>Ten weeks after surgery, Kylie was back on the basketball court. In that first playoff game she scored a three-pointer. And she was on the team when the Lady Eagles from Brock High School, near Weatherford, won the 2A state championship.</p>    <p>&quot;I was thrilled they won the state championship,&quot; Yurvati said. &quot;It's rewarding just to know the importance of that diagnosis and to be able to change a kid's life like that.

But collaborative research at the UNT Health Science Center, UT Dallas, UTA, the Texas Health Research and Education Institute, and Texas Instruments on an e-strip that can measure the equivalent of hemoglobin A1C using saliva may save young patients from a painful step. The small strip is then inserted into a digital reader to read blood glucose levels.</p><p>While the test must be done in a physician's office, eventually the patient may be able to put the test strip on her tongue, then seal the strip in a special mailing envelope and send it to the lab. Diabetic children could avoid a painful process associated with their disease.</p><p>The e-strip is being tested on Type 2 diabetes patients at least 10 years of age. The results will be compared to those of the same gender and similar age.

UNT Health's certified nurse-midwives launched Centering Pregnancy  - the first such program in Fort Worth - two years ago to give expectant mothers a community and resource to answer myriad questions that may not surface during a five-minute doctor visit. Centering combines regular check-ups, prenatal education and discussions in a single visit with other pregnant women. The goal is to improve pre-term labor rates and satisfaction during the entire childbirth experience. <br /><p> <br /><a href=""http://www.nurse-midwife.com/"">Certified nurse-midwives</a> must complete specialized training through the Centering Healthcare Institute.

The patient's partner is welcome to attend. The Centering visit, including the regular patient visit, usually runs 90-120 minutes, Donaldson said. Women are grouped by expected delivery dates so participants can share experiences and insights. </p><p>&quot;You don't have to be a first-time parent to benefit from the Centering experience,&quot; said Elizabeth Marshall, who recently went through UNT Health's Centering program during her pregnancy. &quot;We had a mother on her seventh pregnancy show up to every meeting and she would talk about learning new things from the discussions we had.

Flies, mosquitoes and ticks are just a few of the critters that go along with summer outdoors, and we all do our best to avoid the biting and stinging insects, but what happens if you are accosted by a tick? What are the myths behind Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in Texas?<p>At the UNT Health Science Center, Phillip Williamson, PhD, assistant professor of Forensic and Investigative Genetics and research director of the Tick-Borne Disease Research Laboratory, is considered one of Texas' top experts in tick-borne diseases and continues to research patterns in reported cases of Lyme disease in the state. Since 2004, Williamson has directed Texas' only lab that analyzes Texas ticks and tracks tick-borne diseases.</p><p>&quot;There's a misconception that there is no vulnerability for Lyme disease here in Texas,&quot; Williamson said. &quot;The black-legged deer tick, which commonly carries Lyme disease in the Eastern U.S., isn't the most common pest in Texas. Ninety-five percent of the ticks in Texas are the Lone Star tick. We have documented people in Texas who haven't left the state, yet experience symptoms similar to Lyme disease after being bitten by the Lone Star tick. These symptoms are usually categorized as Southern Tick Associated Rash Illness or STARI, for which doxycycline is prescribed.&quot; </p><p>Last year, research by Williamson, several of the researchers in his lab and collaborators at UNT's Denton campus was published in Emerging Infectious Diseases exploring the type, frequency and distribution of tick-borne pathogens and bacterial agents in Texas.  Their research showed that people in Texas and the Southern U.S. may experience tick-related illnesses very similar to Lyme disease that seem to be transmitted by ticks other than the normal Lyme vector.  And those suffering from these illnesses have the right to be treated for tick-borne diseases.</p><p>That's where Texas legislation passed in the latest session will make a difference.&nbsp; Until recently, it was assumed that Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases don't exist in Texas ticks, and physicians who aggressively treated individuals exhibiting symptoms of Lyme disease could have their licenses revoked.</p><p>Standard treatment following a tick bite would be two weeks of antibiotics. However, longer-term, more aggressive treatment with antibiotics can help prevent Lyme disease in some people --- like Dave Claunch's wife, who developed chronic Lyme disease. Only following a year of strong antibiotic treatment is she feeling well enough to get on with a normal daily life. But Claunch and his wife had to go outside of Texas and fight a disbelieving medical board to get the antibiotic treatment.</p><p>The research that Williamson is conducting in the DNA labs at the UNT Health Science Center is helping the state medical board and physicians better understand tick-borne diseases and create treatments that will prevent the debilitating effects that Claunch's wife had to experience. The new legislation allows physicians in Texas to treat chronic Lyme disease and attend continuing medical education courses to learn more about the disease. </p>",,,,,1015,7/25/11 0:00,Carl E. Everett Education and Administration Building reception held July 15,"<p>A reception honoring Carl Everett, DO, was held July 15 at the UNT Health Science Center. Everett was instrumental in founding and building the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine and the Education and Administration Building has been named after him.</p><p>Everett was born in 1914 in Mountain View, Ark. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Oklahoma and a Doctor of Osteopathy degree from the Kansas City College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1939. He remained in Missouri for the next decade practicing general medicine.</p><p>Everett's friendship with Roy Fisher, founder of the Fort Worth Osteopathic Hospital, brought him and his young family to Fort Worth in 1949.<br /><br />In addition to his long association with the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, Everett served a long term on the board of directors of the Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas and a year as chief of staff.</p><p>&quot;Carl was always instrumental at bringing people together,&quot; recalled Tim Sullivan, son of Everett's longtime business partner, Dorothy Sullivan, whom Everett had first met when she was an administrator of the FWOH on Montgomery Street. Together they built and managed a series of nursing homes across North Texas.  Most, innovatively, featured a clinic staffed daily and used for the care of both the home's residents and employees. At their Western Hills Nursing Home in Fort Worth, Everett and Sullivan partnered with three DOs and three MDs and opened it for TCOM students to use for their geriatric rotations. He added the MDs in part so that osteopathic students could gain experience working with MDs as colleagues, something he felt would be increasingly common over their careers.</p><p>Watch the video of the reception honoring Everett:</p>     <div><object classid=""clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"" codebase=""http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"" width=""640"" height=""390""><param name=""width"" value=""640"" /><param name=""height"" value=""390"" /><param name=""allowfullscreen"" value=""true"" /><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always"" /><param name=""src"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/Ujbpqq2KQvA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"" /><embed type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""640"" height=""390"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/Ujbpqq2KQvA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US""></embed></object></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div>",,,,,1014,7/22/11 0:00,UNTHSC welcomes new Family Medicine chair,"    <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                                     </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]-->  <p><img src=""../../news/upload/Filipetto.jpg"" alt=""Frank Filipetto, DO"" hspace=""3"" vspace=""5"" width=""242"" height=""238"" align=""right"" />Frank Filipetto, DO, recently was named chair of Family Medicine.

And from Lego, another sponsor, she wins two trophies: one for being the overall Grand Prize winner and another for winning the 17-18 age group.</p><p>For her winning project, Bose investigated drug resistance in ovarian cancer. Bose said she became interested in cancer after the death of a close relative. She explored the link between AMPK (the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase) and resistance to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. Bose found that when she inhibited the activity of AMPK, cancer cells reacted in two ways to cisplatin, depending on whether they were resistant to it or not. In non-resistant cells, inhibiting AMPK reduced cell death when they were treated with cisplatin, but in cells that were resistant to the drug, it boosted the cancer-killing effects of the drug.</p><p>Shree and the Health Science Center were recently recognized on <a href=""http://yourbottomline.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/31/girls-fight-science-stereotypes/"" target=""_blank"">CNN</a> for the award.</p>",,,,,1012,7/18/11 0:00,White Coat ceremony set for July 23,"    <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>           </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                                     </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style> <![endif]-->  <p><img src=""../../news/upload/Flores,%20S.jpg"" alt=""Flores, S."" hspace=""5"" vspace=""3"" width=""181"" height=""271"" align=""right"" />The UNT Health Science Center will welcome 240 incoming Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine (TCOM) students, 70 incoming Physician Assistant Studies students and 40 incoming Physical Therapy students into the medical profession at the annual White Coat Ceremony at 2 p.m. on Saturday, July 23, at the Will Rogers Auditorium, 3401 West Lancaster. </p>  <p>Students will don white coats symbolizing their careers in medicine.

This tool allows the agencies to search DNA profiles obtained from forensic evidentiary samples against DNA databases where no matches had been previously obtained and form a list of possible suspects.<p>This new software allows &quot;familial searching,&quot; which is based on the genetic principle that DNA profiles of people who are closely related are likely to contain similarities.</p><p>Once a DNA profile is generated from evidence left at a crime scene, it can be searched against known profiles of convicted felons and arrestees to help identify potential relatives of the true donor of the evidence sample. Typically, familial searching enables associations of parent-child or sibling-sibling relationships. With this new software tool called MPKin FS EditionTM, more investigative leads can be developed using forensic DNA technology and database searches. Police and detectives will have another tool for identifying suspects and potentially solving more violent crimes.</p><p>The software is currently available for licensing.

For example, Luther Franklin was identified as the Grim Sleeper murderer as the result of a familial relationship determined when his son Chris Franklin's DNA was entered into the offender database following a felony weapons charge. </p><p>His future research includes the possibility of matching highly heritable traits in genetic markers against eyewitness testimony. In such a situation, DNA markers can determine highly heritable traits that can then be compared to eyewitness accounts and composite drawings.

Everyone ages. Aging typically increases the chance of disease. Dong-Ming Su, PhD, associate professor of Molecular Biology and Immunology, is researching ways to prevent or delay the onset of diseases related to immune system aging.</p>    <p>The <a href=""http://www.nih.gov/"" target=""_blank"">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a> have provided more than $2 million in support to Su to investigate molecular changes in the thymus, a gland located in the front of the neck that regulates the immune system. The thymus plays an active role in the aging of T cells, white blood cells that attack cells infected by bacteria, viruses or other disease causing organisms.</p>    <p>T cells are part of the adaptive immune system, which is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate or prevent pathogenic challenges and can prepare itself for future challenges. Influenza, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis are all examples of diseases caused from decreasing T cell function.</p>    <p>The thymus shrinks and fat begins to surround it, which prohibits the thymus from producing enough new T cells and fighting disease. Cells in the thymus can be divided into thymic stromal cells and hematopoietic stem cells. Su's research team found that the stromal cells age more rapidly than the stem cells, which challenges traditional thinking.</p>    <p><img src=""../../news/upload/DongMing%20Su.JPG"" alt=""Dong Ming Su"" hspace=""3"" vspace=""3"" width=""293"" height=""222"" align=""right"" />&quot;We are working to find a way to rescue the stromal cells from aging and make the microenvironment younger,&quot; Su said. &quot;If the stromal cells do not age as quickly, the thymus will not shrink as quickly and would be able to produce new T cells.&quot;</p>    <p>Su said this could be accomplished through gene regulation, known as gene therapy, or through a stem-cell based therapy. While still in the early stages of lab research, Su said that gene expression could be stimulated through a simple injection.</p>    <p>&quot;Although we are in the early stages of this research, this could ultimately change lives,&quot; Su said. &quot;The consequences of this research could potentially increase life span and improve quality of life for the elderly.&quot;</p>    ",,,,,996,4/25/11 0:00,Gov.

But could these factors decrease the chances of  developing Alzheimer's disease? <p>Nathalie Sumien, PhD, assistant professor of Pharmacology and  Neuroscience, recently received a two-year grant from the Alzheimer's  Association to examine if a healthy lifestyle including exercising and  taking antioxidant supplements will protect against declines in  cognitive function.</p> <p>In preliminary research, Sumien discovered that combinations of  antioxidants such as vitamin E and coenzyme Q10, or vitamins E and C,  have shown the most promise in reversing cognitive decline. Preliminary  exercise research at the Health Science Center has shown that a moderate  level of exercise training, such as easy jogging or swimming, can have a  minor impact on cognitive function. However, recent studies have  suggested a negative interaction of these two factors, where antioxidant  intake abolished the beneficial effects of exercise.</p> <p>Sumien's study will further explore the interactive effects of  exercise and antioxidant supplementation on cognitive function in  females. It will focus on whether exercise and consuming antioxidants  have more of an impact when done early or later in life. Sumien is  hopeful results of her study will allow her to determine whether  antioxidant intake should be recommended for healthy aged and  Alzheimer's patients engaging in moderate exercise.</p>  ",,,,,994,4/12/11 0:00,Neurobiology of Aging Trainee Symposium scheduled for April 15,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]-->  <p><img src=""../../news/upload/Griffin.jpg"" alt=""W.

Furthermore, analysis indicated that patrons who consumed alcohol mixed with energy drinks, on average, exited a bar later in the evening, engaged in drinking for a longer period of time, consumed more total drinks and more grams of ethanol, compared to patrons who did not consume energy dinks that night or who consumed energy drinks and alcohol at different times in the same night (not mixed together).</p><p>Thombs and his findings were part of a segment televised on Canadian TV's investigative program &quot;16:9&quot; this weekend. </p>",,,,,990,4/1/11 0:00,‰Û÷Good cholesterol‰Ûª nanoparticles seek and destroy cancer cells ,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style> <![endif]-->  <p><img src=""../../news/upload/Lacko.jpg"" alt=""Dr. Lacko"" hspace=""5"" vspace=""2"" width=""199"" height=""308"" align=""right"" />High-density lipoprotein's hauls excess cholesterol to the liver for disposal, but new research suggests &quot;good cholesterol&quot; can also act as a special delivery vehicle of destruction for cancer. </p>    <p>Synthetic HDL nanoparticles loaded with small interfering RNA to silence cancer-promoting genes selectively shrunk or destroyed ovarian cancer tumors in mice, a research team led by scientists from The University of Texas <a href=""http://www.mdanderson.org/"">MD Anderson Cancer Center</a> and the <a href=""http://unthsc.edu/news/newsrelease.cfm?ID=987"">University of North Texas Health Science Center</a> reports in the April edition of Neoplasia.</p>    <p>&quot;RNA interference has great therapeutic potential but delivering it to cancer cells has been problematic,&quot; said Anil Sood, M.D., the study's senior author and MD Anderson's director of Ovarian Cancer Research and co-director of the Center for RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNA at MD Anderson. &quot;Combining siRNA with HDL provides an efficient way to get these molecules to their targets. This study has several important implications in the ability to fight certain cancers.&quot;</p>    <p>Sood and Andras Lacko, Ph.D., professor of <a href=""../../mbi/"">Molecular Biology and Immunology</a> at UNT Health Science Center, jointly developed the nanoparticles, which build on Lacko's original insight about HDL's potential for cancer drug delivery.&nbsp; </p>    <p>The next step is to prepare for human clinical trials, the two scientists said.&nbsp; &quot;If we can knock out 70, 80 or 90 percent of tumors without drug accumulation in normal tissues in mice, it is likely that many cancer patients could benefit from this new type of treatment in the long run,&quot; Lacko said.</p>    <p><strong>Only cancer and liver cells express HDL receptor</strong></p>    <p>Previous studies have shown that cancer cells attract and scavenge HDL by producing high levels of its receptor, SR-B1. As cancer cells take in HDL, they grow and proliferate. The only other site in the body that makes SR-B1 receptor is the liver. This selectivity for cancer cells protects normal, healthy cells from side effects.</p>    <p>Previous attempts to deliver siRNA by lipsomes and other nanoparticles have been hampered by toxicity and other concerns. The tiny bits of RNA, which regulate genes in a highly targeted fashion, can't simply be injected, for example.</p>    <p>&quot;If siRNA is not in a nanoparticle, it gets broken down and excreted before it can be effective,&quot; Sood said. &quot;HDL is completely biocompatible and is a safety improvement over other types of nanoparticles.&quot;</p>    <p>The team developed a synthetic version of HDL, called rHDL, because it's more stable than the natural version.</p>    <p><strong>Fewer and smaller tumors, less toxicity</strong></p>    <p>Using rHDL as a delivery method has other advantages as well. rHDL has not shown to cause immunologic responses, helping to minimize potential side effects, Lacko said, and it exhibits longer time in circulation than other drug formulations or lipoproteins. Also, because SR-B1 is found only in the liver, an rHDL vehicle will help block and treat metastasis to that organ. </p>    <p>__________________________________________________________________</p>    <p>Researchers first confirmed the distribution of SR-B1 and the uptake of rHDL nanoparticles in mice injected with cancer cells. They found that siRNA was distributed evenly in about 80 percent of a treated tumor.&nbsp; As expected, the nanoparticles accumulated in the liver with minimal or no delivery to the brain, heart, lung, kidney or spleen. Safety studies showed uptake in the liver did not cause adverse effects.</p>  <p>Using siRNA tailored to the individual gene, the researchers separately shut down the genes STAT3 and FAK in various types of treatment-resistant ovarian cancer tumors. STAT3 and FAK are important to cancer growth, progression and metastasis; however, they also play important roles in normal tissue so targeting precision is vital.</p>  <p>The siRNA/rHDL formulation alone reduced the size and number of tumors by 60 to 80 percent. Combinations with chemotherapy caused reductions above 90 percent. </p>  <p>Conventional approaches to target STAT3 have met limited success, Sood said. FAK, which is over expressed in colorectal, breast, ovarian, thyroid and prostate cancers, is particularly aggressive in ovarian cancer and one reason for its poor survival rate. While previous attempts have targeted FAK with liposomal nanoparticles or small molecule inhibitors, these methods are not tumor-specific and are more likely to harm normal cells, the scientists noted. </p>  <p><strong>Next Step: Clinical Studies</strong></p>  <p>&quot;In order to help expedite the study's progress to a clinical setting, we have identified 12 genes as biomarkers for response to STAT3-targeted therapy,&quot; Sood said. &quot;Next, we'll work with the National Cancer Institute Nanoparticle Characterization Lab to develop a formulation of the HDL/siRNA nanoparticle for human use.&quot;</p>  <p>MD Anderson and UNT have applied for a patent for the nanoparticle delivery method.

The report shows that the educational program contributed to approximately 50 percent fewer hospital admissions due to complications of COPD, which saved the Texas' health care system $3.4 million.&nbsp; </p>    <p>The educational initiative, proposed and conducted by the UNT Health Science Center and funded by Boehringer Ingelheim and <a href=""http://pfizer.com/home/"">Pfizer</a> (NYSE:PFE), educated more than 350 health care professionals in the rural areas of East Texas to improve their ability to talk to patients about the condition and more accurately test for and treat COPD. </p>    <p>COPD is responsible for one death every four minutes in the US and at least 12 million cases remain undiagnosed. Between 2005 and 2008 in Texas, COPD was responsible for more than 109,000 hospitalizations costing more than $2.7 billion. The Health Science Center researched Texas health data and current literature, which formed the basis of the proposal. The grant requests were funded, and UNTHSC independently launched a series of continuing medical education (CME) activities and follow-up cases targeting the counties in East Texas with the highest rates of preventable hospitalizations due to COPD. </p>    <p>To measure the long-term outcomes, researchers looked at the number of prescriptions for drugs recommended to treat COPD, the number of new diagnoses and the number of potentially preventable hospitalizations caused by COPD reported by the Texas Department of State Health Services.</p>The Texas Public Use Data File, a combined set of statistics reported by each hospital in the state, shows that two to three months before the health care providers in these counties attended the activities, there were 1,538 potentially preventable hospitalizations due to COPD. In the same time period following the programs, only 1,402 were observed - a reduction of 136. The data also show that other counties of similar size and population saw reductions, but the counties targeted by the study saw a 49 percent greater reduction, saving the health care system more than $3.4 million.  <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>        </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                                     </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]-->",,,,,979,3/3/11 0:00,Cowboy‰Ûªs Tashard Choice to speak to students March 7,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                                     </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]-->  <p><a href=""http://www.dallascowboys.com/""><img src=""../../news/upload/Dallas-Cowboys-star.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Dallas Cowboy Star"" vspace=""0"" width=""213"" height=""197"" align=""right"" />Dallas Cowboy</a> Tashard Choice will speak to UNT Health Science Center students, faculty and staff about physical medicine and rehabilitation on March 7.

Dennis Thombs, PhD, chair and professor of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the UNT Health Science Center's <a href=""../../education/SPH/"">School of Public Health</a>, analyzed data collected via nighttime, sidewalk interviews and questionnaires, and biological tests. &nbsp;</p>  <p>The 5-HTTLPR genetic marker is commonly reported in three forms based on allele length: L/L (two long alleles), S/L (one long and one short allele), and S/S (two short alleles). An allele is one of two or more forms of the DNA sequence of a particular gene. Most research has shown that the S/S type is associated with psychological distress and problem behavior. Approximately 20 percent of the general population has the S/S trait. </p>  <p>Thombs conducted the study in a bar district of a large college campus community that included seven establishments that served alcohol after 10 p.m. Anonymous data and saliva samples were collected after 10 p.m. during four nights in July and August 2007 as patrons exited one of the drinking establishments. Results showed that bar patrons with the S/S genotype were three times more likely to intend to drive a motor vehicle after leaving the bar than those patrons with the L/L genotype. These findings align with previous research that associates this genetic marker with impulsivity and a lower regard for rules. </p>  <p>&quot;Certainly, genetic traits do not mandate that a person drinks heavily or drives after drinking, but the results suggest these issues may be more complicated than being a matter of knowing right and wrong,&quot; Thombs said. &quot;The findings may also be important to explaining the major public safety problem involving persistent DUI offenders - those thousands of persons that keep offending again and again despite being convicted.&quot;</p>    ",,,,,974,2/21/11 0:00,UNT Health Science Center facility earns LEED Gold,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>           </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                                         </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]-->  <p><img src=""../../news/upload/MET%20cropped.jpg"" alt=""MET Building"" hspace=""5"" vspace=""5"" width=""298"" height=""200"" align=""right"" />The University of North Texas Health Science Center&lsquo;s&nbsp; newest facility, the Medical Education and Training Building which opened in May, has received a LEED Gold designation for meeting strict environmental standards.&nbsp; </p>    <p>The Medical Education and Training Building on the Health Science Center's Fort Worth campus is the first <a href=""http://untsystem.unt.edu/"">UNT System</a> facility to be designated LEED Gold.

Now, more than 20 JAMP students have been accepted to TCOM, with the first three graduating in 2010.<br /> <br /> Created in 2000 by the 77<sup>th</sup> Texas Legislature, JAMP was designed to support and encourage highly qualified, economically disadvantaged students to pursue medical careers in Texas. Students in the program receive financial support, mentoring, hands-on experience and guaranteed admission to a Texas medical school. Each summer, JAMP students go to one of the eight medical schools in Texas and complete a rigorous curriculum of courses. During the five-week summer program at the Health Science Center, JAMP students attend seminars and lectures, take tours of the various medical and research labs on campus and participate in a clinical preceptorship which includes mentoring, preparation for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), and teambuilding and leadership-development activities.</p><p>&quot;The summer programs gave me a glimpse of life as a medical student,&quot; Vanna Stotts (TCOM '13) said. &quot;It gave me the opportunity to talk to JAMP students that were in medical school at that time and ask questions. When&nbsp;I started medical school, I felt more comfortable knowing I had already been through classes made to simulate first-year courses.&quot;</p>    <p>Since 2003, 195 JAMP students have been accepted to medical school in Texas. The first class of JAMP participants graduated from medical school in the spring of 2010. Seventy percent of the first graduating class matched to residency training positions in Texas, and 61 percent selected primary care for residency training. </p>    <p>Fernando Vasquez, assistant director of Medical Admissions and JAMP coordinator at the Health Science Center, said JAMP has provided hundreds of economically disadvantaged students with additional mentoring and financial support over the past seven years. The program has grown from 81 incoming students in 2003 to 152 in 2009 and recently received the 2010 Texas Higher Education Star Award.</p>    <p>&quot;By focusing on student success, JAMP has positioned itself to be a viable pathway for students who otherwise may not have considered medical school,&quot; Vasquez said. &quot;JAMP is now a recognized and formidable program that enhances the educational opportunities for these students who have the academic talent to succeed, while diversifying the face of medicine.&quot;</p>    <p>For more information, contact <a href=""mailto:fernando.vasquez@unthsc.edu"">Fernando Vasquez</a> at 817-735-2204 or <a href=""http://www.utsystem.edu/jamp/Forms/2010%20Governors%20Report.pdf"">click here</a> to read the 2010 Program Report.</p>    ",,,,,965,1/11/11 0:00,Health Science Center closed for MLK Day,"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]-->  <p><img src=""../../news/upload/Aerial%20photo%20cropped.jpg"" alt=""Aerial photo of UNTHSC"" hspace=""5"" vspace=""5"" width=""250"" align=""right"" />The UNT Health Science Center will be closed on Monday, Jan. 17, in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

The method consists of injecting glyceryl monooleate- (GMO) coated magnetic nanoparticles loaded with curcumin into the blood stream and applying the magnet at the tumor site. As the blood circulates, the GMO-coated magnetic nano particles are trapped by the magnetic field, and cancer cells take in the GMO-coated magnetic nano particles. Curcumin is then diffused from the GMO-coated magnetic nano particles inside the cell and induces the cancer cell to undergo apoptosis, programmed cell death.</p>    <p>The Ronald E.

The study is funded by the<a href=""http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/""> National Institutes of Health's Heart, Lung and Blood Institute</a>. </p>    <p>People who live in an environment where nutrition and exercise are carefully monitored can reduce their risk for these diseases, even if their genes are working against them. However, most people do not live in a controlled environment, eat what they like and have access to, and often do not exercise.</p>    <p>DeHaven's GoodNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness and Spiritual Growth) Program works with African-American church attendees in South Dallas to determine if community-based efforts to encourage healthy diets and physical activity &nbsp;reduce risk factors for heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Health care accounts for 10 percent of a person's risk of premature mortality. Lifestyle and behaviors represent 50 percent of the risk. Twenty percent is related to environment, and another 20 percent is genetics.</p>    &quot;This tells us that we do have a great deal of control over our health,&quot; DeHaven said. &quot;Our study participants had always assumed they would die young because their relatives died young. Now they get it - they know that they can influence their risk factors for these diseases. They know they don't have to die young.&quot;  ",,,,,949,10/15/10 0:00,October seminars highlight women's health issues,"  <p>The UNT Health Science Center's <a href=""../../research/ForHER/index.html"">FOR HER</a> women's health institute will host two educational seminars during October.</p>    <p>A lunch-and-learn session, sponsored by The Lalor Foundation, will be held Tuesday, Oct. 19, in the Health Science Center's Medical Education and Training Building, to provide information about emergency contraception.

As a result, alcoholism continues to be a problem among adults and adolescents, and withdrawal from alcohol continues to cause disruptions as individuals and their families deal with both the physical and emotional trauma of weaning their bodies and minds from the effects of alcohol abuse. New research at the Health Science Center examines the effects of intermittent hypoxia - cycles of a moderately low level versus a normal level of oxygen - on the body's ability to adjust to alcohol withdrawal.&nbsp; </p>    <p>&quot;When a patient is exposed to intermittent hypoxia over time, the body learns to adapt to the stress of low oxygen,&quot; said Marianna Jung, PhD ('97), assistant professor of Pharmacology and principal investigator for the study, funded by the National Institutes of Health. &quot;By introducing intermittent hypoxia for 20 days and training the brain to deal with stress, we hope to show that the brain can be protected from excessive stress of alcohol withdrawal.&quot;</p>    <p>At the suggestion of Fred Downey, PhD, vice chair of Integrative Physiology, Jung is working with Robert Mallet, PhD, professor of Integrative Physiology, in testing the theory. During the first phase of testing, subjects exposed to intermittent hypoxia prior to experiencing sudden alcohol withdrawal were calmer and suffered less stress than subjects who were not subjected to hypoxia pre-conditioning. Subjects without hypoxia treatment were more hyperactive and more apt to suffer seizures during withdrawal.</p>    <p>The hope is that further evaluation will result in therapies that can improve the recovery time for patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal.</p>    ",,,,,937,9/14/10 0:00,School of Public Health introduces MPH professional option,"<p>The School of Public Health now offers a new generalist Master of Public Health Professional Option program that can be completed entirely through evening courses.

The requirements were to secure all necessary start-up funding from the community, establish a business plan for the new school, ensure commitments to secure a strong future for all existing programs, and confirm relationships with area hospitals for student rotations and graduate training.&nbsp; </p>    <p>Over the past two years, UNTHSC has conducted extensive fiscal and academic planning to determine how its existing infrastructure would optimally support two separately accredited medical programs at one location.&nbsp; With this unique sharing opportunity, the business and academic plan estimated the start-up costs for starting the new MD program will total $21.5 million, well below what is normally estimated without existing infrastructure. </p>    <p>&quot;This innovative private-public proposal is particularly important as the state responds to financial challenges by allowing the local community to provide all start-up funds for a new medical school as a method to address the growing physician shortages across the state,&quot; said UNTHSC President Scott Ransom.&nbsp; </p>    <p>The Fort Worth health care, business and civic community has already pledged $25 million of financial support to cover the initial incremental and all start-up costs.&nbsp; Written partnership agreements as well as substantial financial pledges were obtained with <a href=""http://www.texashealth.org/"">Texas Health Resources</a>, Tarrant County Hospital District, <a href=""http://www.baylorhealth.com/Pages/default-bhcs.aspx"">Baylor Health System</a>, <a href=""http://www.hcanorthtexas.com/"">HCA North Texas</a>/<a href=""http://www.plazamedicalcenter.com/"">Plaza Medical Center</a>, and <a href=""https://www.cookchildrens.org/Pages/default.aspx"">Cook Children's Health System</a>. </p>    <p>The only cost to the State of Texas will be the usual and appropriate costs associated with additional Texas medical students beginning in five years. </p>    <p>&quot;There is a great deal of excitement about this opportunity in Fort Worth as a logical progression of the Health Science Center's ongoing growth and success,&quot; said UNTHSC Foundation Board member George Pepper. &quot;The Fort Worth community has demonstrated tremendous commitment, which now allows us to take this proposal forward.&quot;</p>    UNTHSC will now begin discussions with members of the Texas Legislature regarding the state's process for approval of the proposed MD school.

But at what age are cancer patients no longer children? When should they be treated as &quot;adult&quot; cancer patients? Should a 17-year-old dealing with leukemia be treated as an adult on his 18th birthday? Or should he be given the same treatments as an eight-year-old with the same disease? And, perhaps as importantly, does leukemia behave the same way in a teen as in a child or a 38-year-old?</p><p>These are the questions that drive one of the Health Science Center's newest faculty members, Karen Albritton, MD, director of Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology at the UNT Health Science Center. Albritton is a pioneer in the emerging specialty of AYA Oncology, recognized by the National Cancer Institute as the field focusing on the science and care of those diagnosed with cancer between age 15 and 40. The specialty had its start in the early part of the last decade, when reviews of clinical trial results in seven different countries, 64 percent of acute leukemia patients age 16-21 who were treated as pediatric patients experienced successful outcomes, versus 38 percent who were treated as adults. The fact that the same results were replicated seven times is astounding.</p><p>Albritton believes these findings indicate that cancers in young adults will not respond to treatment the same as cancer in children or older adults. She hopes to learn if the reasons relate to tumor biology differences, drug protocols, service delivery, support networks or other reasons. Because the answers are both about clinical care and basic science, Albritton will bring together researchers at the Health Science Center clinicians at Cook Children's Hospital Network and community cancer organizations throughout the North and West Texas regions to establish the North Texas AYA Oncology Center. As a resource for researchers, families and physicians caring for young people with cancer, the AYA Oncology Center will serve as both a repository of information, facilitator of research and brain trust for medical oncology groups serving the major health care providers in the region.</p>",,,,,911,6/2/10 0:00,"UNTHSC gets $300,000 CPRIT grant","<p>The <a href=""http://www.cprit.state.tx.us/"">Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</a> (CPRIT)&nbsp;recently presented a $300,000 check to the <a href=""../..//"">University of North Texas Health Science Center</a>&nbsp;for a cancer prevention program in South Dallas.&nbsp; The check was accepted by&nbsp;Provost Thomas Yorio and Dean Richard Kurz from&nbsp;School of Public Health.</p><p>These monies, part of CPRIT's $61 million inaugural grants, will fund a prevention program at the university under Dr. Kathryn Cardarelli, principal investigator.

These studies are critical because fewer than 5 percent of the 1,000 Americans who suffer sudden cardiac arrest survive.</p><p>&quot;The hope is to devise an intervention so when emergency medical personnel show up and they deduce that someone has had traumatic brain injury, a stroke or sudden cardiac arrest, they can then, on site, administer something that can protect the brain,&quot; Simpkins said. &quot;If we can administer these drugs to people very early, we can protect the brain and increase survival.&quot;</p><p>This new study has found that the rapid administration of a combined dose of estrogen, a strong anti-oxidant and an anti-inflammatory drug in sudden cardiac arrest cases increases brain cell survival by up to 65 percent. Additionally, it was found that the same combination of estrogen and other substances delivered intravenously post-injury may have similar effects in subjects suffering from traumatic brain injury.</p><p>Simpkins explained that right now, emergency medicine procedures are in place to immediately work to resuscitate patients who have suffered one of these traumas, but typically resuscitation efforts are designed to make a person's heart start beating again, for example, or restart breathing. However, until now, no measures have been put into place to attempt to protect the brain's health in the case of a traumatic injury requiring resuscitation efforts.</p><p>&quot;We have to act as soon as possible when emergency medical crews arrive on the scene,&quot; Simpkins said. He explained that by the time an emergency crew has performed resuscitation efforts, then transported a patient to a hospital, and the patient is stabilized enough to undergo the tests necessary to determine if there is brain injury, it is often too late.</p><p>&quot;We know these substances can protect the brain and are safe to send out with emergency medicine personnel,&quot; he said. These compounds can be easily administered to a patient on-scene to provide the necessary protection to the brain. Importantly, the compounds have no dangerous effects on a patient if they do not have any sort of brain injury.</p><p>Simpkins said he is passionate about this study because he lost his father and grandfather to strokes - but there were no medical procedures in place to protect the men's lives. By the time the necessary help arrived and tests were run, it was too late, Simpkins said.</p><p>&quot;There has to be a paradigm shift in that we need to administer these treatments as soon as possible, before it is too late,&quot; he said. &quot;This can improve survival and reduce neurological deficits from shock. It is very much needed.&quot;</p><p>This study is part of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium, a National Institutes of Health-funded program designed to study cardiac arrest and trauma events in patients, the outcomes of these events, and how treatment in the field immediately after these events affect patient survival rates.</p>",,,,,898,5/5/10 0:00,New banners mark Health Science Center's 40th anniversary,"<p>Look for the new banners along Camp Bowie Boulevard which commemorate the Health Science Center's 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary.

Although the vast majority of individuals suffering from Alzheimer's are over the age of 65, onset at earlier ages is becoming more common. Over time, the disorder leads to behavioral and personality changes, memory loss, confusion, inability to learn new material and deterioration in language and motor skills. It is progressive, and, in later stages, Alzheimer's patients lose the ability to communicate. Today, it is one of the leading causes of death in the United States.</p><p>In collaboration with the state-funded Texas Alzheimer's Research Consortium (TARC), James Hall, PhD, participates in group and individual research to improve early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the disease afflicting more than 5 million Americans. TARC consists of five of the state's leading medical research institutions. Baylor College of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Texas Tech Health Science Center, UNT Health Science Center and University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio hope to identify the genes and biomarkers associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. </p><p>Hall serves on the TARC neuropsychology committee for the UNT Health Science Center, advising on protocols for neuropsychological testing and reviewing proposed research projects. Each institution within the consortium conducts research and contributes genetic and blood biomarker data on Alzheimer's patients and healthy control subjects to the shared Texas Alzheimer's DataBank.</p><p>&quot;Our short-term goal is to gain a better understanding of the nature of the disease,&quot; Hall said. &quot;Over time, we hope to establish further understanding of those factors that contribute to the onset on Alzheimer's and, from that, create methods to decelerate or prevent progression of the disease.&quot;</p><p>Hall specifically focuses on the relationship between depression and Alzheimer's disease in which certain clusters of depression symptoms seem to be related to the development of the disease. Individuals with a history of depression are at a greater risk for developing the disease.</p><p>The Health Science Center's Thomas Fairchild, PhD, vice president for the Office of Strategy and Measurement, and Janice Knebl, DO, endowed professor and recipient of a Reynolds Foundation grant for research in aging, are active in TARC's research efforts. Fairchild serves as the TARC principal investigator for the Health Science Center, and Knebl is clinical director.</p><p>The first state funding for Alzheimer's research in Texas history was approved in 2005 by the 79th Texas Legislature, which appropriated $2 million to fund TARC's first two years of set-up, volunteer recruitment and data collection. In 2007, Texas lawmakers nearly doubled the state's investment in the consortium. Most recently, state lawmakers approved another $6.8 million for TARC over the next two years to build on its early work, recruit more volunteers (including those with mild cognitive impairment) and launch a new research focus on the impact of Alzheimer's disease on Hispanics.</p><p>&quot;The more we understand about the early stages of Alzheimer's and the level of impairment it has on brain functions, the more we can intervene to slow down or even prevent the disease in the future,&quot; Hall said.</p>",,,,,895,4/28/10 0:00,Research in Integrative Physiology department attracts top talent,"<p>The University of North Texas Health Science Center has big plans for its Department of Integrative Physiology.

In addition, the supportive environment that fosters interdisciplinary research was an added benefit.</p><p>Mifflin's lab researches the ways that neurons in the brain adapt to pathophysiological conditions and contribute to the cardiovascular complications observed in these conditions.</p><p>&quot;We study these adaptive processes in incidents of high blood pressure and exposure to reduced oxygen as occurs in heart failure and sleep apnea,&quot; Mifflin explained. &quot;Our research has garnered a great deal of interest because it mimics many of the problems observed in sleep apnea patients - high blood pressure, insulin resistance, etc. It also is a good example of what is meant by integrative physiology - which is research that integrates information obtained from molecular to cellular to organ to human levels - to achieve a much more complete picture of pathology than one obtains using information obtained from a single level of analysis.&quot;</p><p>Cunningham leads the Health Science Center's Cardiovascular Research Institute. &quot;In my lab, we study the role of the brain in controlling the cardiovascular system, and water and electrolyte balance,&quot; Cunningham said. &quot;Some research focuses on determining how the brain participates in the normal regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance, a process called homeostasis. Other studies explore how changes in central nervous system function contribute to chronic diseases like hypertension, and water or salt retention that can be associated with heart disease or liver failure.&quot;</p><p>The researchers share a common vision when it comes to their hopes that their research will lead to identifying new ways to treat these afflictions and improve the quality of people's lives. They also hope their research will provide a better understanding of the ways that the brain regulates physiological processes that are necessary for a normal, healthy life.</p><p>&quot;Relocating to UNTHSC will help us achieve these goals through new collaborative relationships,&quot;</p><p>Cunningham continued. &quot;We are working with investigators in the department to determine if any of the changes we have reported in our animal models of disease are present in humans who suffer from high blood pressure or sleep apnea. If so, our work could provide insights into novel therapeutic targets for treatment,&quot; Mifflin said. &quot;In terms of opportunities for collaboration, the Cardiovascular Research Institute is a wonderful example. The institute will facilitate interactions and collaborations between investigators studying the cardiovascular complications of high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, heart failure, stress and other conditions prevalent in Texas and the United States.&quot;</p><p>Mifflin and Cunningham are impressed with the friendly, supportive environment that has welcomed them to Fort Worth and the Health Science Center.</p><p>&quot;Resources provided by the institution have allowed us to expand the scope of our work, creating new opportunities to compete for external funding and provide training for students from the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine,&quot; Cunningham concluded.</p>",,,,,894,4/30/10 0:00,Arbor Day: UNTHSC helping to protect environment,"<p>April 30 is Arbor Day, and the Health Science Center continues to do its part to protect the environment with activities ranging from the Living Legacy plantings as living tributes to installing a better light bulb.</p><p>The Living Legacy program allows donors to select a tree or other plants to be planted in honor of a special person or occasion, or to remember a lost loved one. The donors pay for the item(s) to be planted, help select the plant and location, and each planting is marked with an engraved granite plaque.</p><p>Last year, nine trees were added to the campus through the Living Legacy program - helping protect air quality and beautifying the grounds. The grounds keeping force cares for these plantings and all landscaping using earth-friendly Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques. IPM encourages careful monitoring of cultural practices, watering and maintenance to ensure the plants are as healthy as possible.

Data evaluated at the <a href=""../..//"">University of North Texas Health Science Center</a> has not only shown the <a href=""http://pdinewlife.org/"">Prostitute Diversion Initiative (PDI)</a> is getting prostitutes off the streets, it is lowering crime rates in areas frequented by prostitutes along Dallas' I-20 corridor. </p><p><strong>Profile of a Prostitute</strong></p><p>Surprising data reveals of the 371 adult prostitutes contacted as part of the Dallas PDI over the last two years, 54 percent tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease, with the most prevalent being syphilis, said &nbsp;Martha Felini, PhD, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Health Science Center <a href=""../../education/SPH/"">School of Public Health</a>. Of the truck stop prostitutes tested, about 30 percent had the disease, similar to the statistics found in underdeveloped countries. Almost half &nbsp;of the prostitutes were high school graduates or had higher education, and 54 percent reported having a mental health condition, with over half of those reporting having more than one. </p><p><strong>Victim vs. Criminal</strong></p><p>The PDI's ultimate goal is to change the way law enforcement and other institutions approach those involved in prostitution.</p><p>&quot;The purpose of the PDI is to give these victims a choice,&quot; Felini said. &quot;By bringing resources to the streets we've learned these women have suffered a lifetime of trauma and their drug addictions are helping them cope with co-occurring mental health conditions. Should those eligible opt for treatment in lieu of jail, they can get immediate and appropriate care that will give them a fighting chance at recovery and a new life.&quot;</p><p>Results show that 60 percent of those eligible opted to go into treatment. With 23 people completing the initial phase of the treatment program, 65 percent of these remain abstinent and in supportive care services with no subsequent arrests in Dallas County.</p><p><strong>Continuing Research</strong></p><p>&quot;As the PDI enters its third year, we anticipate seeing the impact of the program over the longer term,&quot; Felini said. &quot;In other words, will those successes in the first year continue to remain off the streets in two years? The statistics thus far indicate that the initial phase of the treatment is critical, but challenges remain in defining success in this migratory population. Part of this equation for determining success will become more demonstrable as the PDI expands its collaboration to other cities.&quot;</p><p>This year, with the collaboration of the <a href=""http://www.unthumanid.org/"">UNT Center for Human Identification</a>, a High-Risk Potential Victim's DNA Database will be implemented into the PDI , the first of its kind in the nation. Given that prostitutes are 18 times more likely to be murdered than women of similar age and race, this database will provide law enforcement a forensic tool to aid in post-mortem identification of victims and advocate for the prostitute in finding his or her killer. In addition, it can help provide closure to the victim's families searching for missing loved ones.</p><p><strong>From Facts and Figures to Real World Results</strong></p><p>Atlanta, Las Vegas, Montreal and South Korea are looking at the program and have contacted the DPD for more information on the PDI.&nbsp; </p><p>&quot;In order to help establish a program in areas outside of the United States, we will have to look carefully at cultural differences to obtain the greatest success,&quot; Felini said. &quot;The PDI demonstrates a respect for women's rights and recognition of mental health conditions as treatable. But many countries have a different perception of women, and those with mental health conditions are ostracized.</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;The challenge we face today is humanizing the data we have analyzed. Most people are unaware of the prostitute population and believe that those individuals &lsquo;get what they deserve.' Regardless of your position on prostitution, information about this population is important to our understanding of mental health, cancer and infectious disease, all which affect the general population. We cannot afford to continue ignoring this marginalized group,&quot; Felini said.</p><p>The Health Science Center will continue to evaluate the program as it expands and is implemented by other cities.

After joining the team also consisting of an anthropologist, odontologist, and medical examiner, Roby recommended the Health Science Center lab to perform the DNA analysis for the Chilean government. The UNT Center for Human Identification was able to report family associations for Pablo Aranda Schmied, Waldemar Monsalve Toledo, and Nelson Mu&ntilde;oz Torres with 99.99 posterior probability. All three were killed during General Augusto Pinochet's ascension to power, which began Sept. 11, 1973.<br /><br />To insure accurate identification testing, Roby followed a strict protocol for cutting the bones of exhumed bodies. The UNT Center for Human Identification used the process modeled after that of the existing successful Missing Persons Program.<br /><br />The Health Science Center has many key players in the genetic analysis process. Dixie Peters, technical leader for the Missing Persons Program, and her team compile databases of bone samples from unidentified remains and family references from relatives of victims, comparing them to one another. Melody Josserand, Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) administrator, uses a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) software program to search for matches in DNA. Roby then independently reviews the results from the lab, writes a summary report to the Human Rights Program of the Chilean government explaining what the results mean, and if results allow, writes a subsequent report to the Chilean government recommending identification.<br /><br />&quot;This has been an exciting path that will continue to produce results,&quot; Roby said. &quot;We continually discover more to help us identify victims and I feel confident that more identifications will be made in the near future.&quot;<br /><br />In addition to her work in Chile, Roby has played a large role in identifying Czar Nicholas II and the Romanov family, Vietnam War soldiers, and 9-11 World Trade Center victims.<br /><br />&quot;I can't imagine what it would be like to lose a member of my family and it is incredibly fulfilling to help others find the truth.

Find a New """"Home""""","<br />Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed President Obama's landmark health care legislation. And while the president expressed hopes that he would be able to sign the bill into law before the end of this year, opponents of the plan in the Senate are likely to move the vote into 2010. <p>That's really no surprise: A political hot potato like health care reform is bound to engender strong, passionate debate. But one recommendation from the reform package should not be ignored. The so-called &quot;medical home&quot; is a good idea whose time is finally nigh, regardless of the health care debate outcome.</p><p>First put forward by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1967, today's version of the medical home integrates the concept of the old-time family doctor with a whole-person approach to specialty care, supported by networked teams of specialists in a collaborative environment. Led by a patient's personal physician, a team of individuals at the practice level collectively takes responsibility for a patient's ongoing care throughout the various life stages that include acute care, chronic care preventive services and end-of-life (palliative) care. </p><p>A medical home integrates all elements of the health care system (e.g., subspecialty care, hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes) with the patient's community (e.g., family, as well as public and private services). As a result, patients receive a far more logical flow of care than is available in today's expensive, fragmented, specialty approach.</p><p>More and more organizations are coming together in favor of the medical home concept. The American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Osteopathic Association and the American Association of Medical Colleges, all support various versions of the concept.</p><p>But there are many questions and ongoing studies regarding whether or not a medical home achieves better and cheaper results than more traditional methods of care.</p><p>One major concern is the role of primary care physicians as the patient's first stop and the central hub of the medical home. Primary care physicians are in short supply due to relatively low pay, long hours and mountains of paperwork. Many medical students simply focus on more profitable areas of specialization. </p><p>Other concerns revolve around the role of the primary care physician as gatekeeper rather than care provider, and the high cost of implementing EMR (Electronic Medical Records) systems, to ensure throughput of patient data. </p><p>Nevertheless, a number of government agencies, public and private organizations, insurance companies, and others are testing various aspects of the medical home.</p><p>At least 20 bills in 10 states have been introduced this year to promote the concept of medical homes. Earlier this year, the Obama administration announced pilot medical home projects for the Medicare health insurance program for the elderly. In September, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois launched a medical home program involving more than 20,000 health plan members. (If successful, the insurer will open it up to more of its 7.2 million health plan members).</p><p>The New England Journal of Medicine also published recommendations for the success of medical homes that included increased sharing of information across health care providers, the broadening of performance measures, and the establishment of payment systems that share savings with the physicians involved. A final report on a medical home national demonstration project by the American Academy of Family Physicians, which began in 2006 at 36 sites, will be published in 2010.</p><p>If these ambitious medical home pilots improve care and control costs, they could serve as a national model for health system improvement. An oft-cited (and admittedly old) report from the Annals of Family Medicine showed that health care quality would improve and costs would decrease by more than 5 percent, or $67 billion per year, if every American had a medical home. And even though the data may be from 2004, the significance of the findings remains valid. </p><p>As businesspeople, we must face facts: the number of uninsured Americans jumped from 45.7 million in 2007 to 46.3 million in 2008, as unemployment and the recession forced people to end insurance payments. Many of these individuals are now forced to forego treatment for chronic diseases, which will simply delay the inevitable and ratchet up health care costs over the long-term. Meanwhile, the number of available physicians is falling, as seen by study after study from state after state. Over the long haul, our nation's productivity and leadership will pay the price for this unbalanced equation. </p><p>As long as we're contemplating the largest expansion of health care coverage since Medicare was created more than 40 years ago, shouldn't we make sure it's an investment in a system that works? The concept of a medical home may not yet be perfect, but surely it can be part of an overall answer to the looming primary physician shortage and offer a higher level of continuous professional care to our fellow citizens that they're not getting now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>-- From the Nov. 23 issue of the <a href=""http://www.fwbusinesspress.com/display.php?id=11437"">Fort Worth Business Press </a>",,,,,805,12/1/09 0:00,Your sources for weather closing information,"When the weather turns to snow and ice, check these sources for Health Science Center closing information:<p>    * Call the main phone number, 817-735-2000.

His concept of medical care continuity quickly became the standard for medical record keeping around the world. <p>I wonder what Dr. Plummer would make of today's adoption of electronic medical records (EMR) by U.S. health care providers? After all, the concept is basically the same, just expanded to take advantage of today's capacious electronic storage and retrieval methods. </p><p>Even the federal government has gotten into the act, defining a complete EMR system as containing four basic functions: computerized orders for prescriptions, computerized orders for tests, reporting of test results and physician notes.</p><p>In a perfect world, an EMR system tracks a patient's entire health and medical history in a computerized, electronic format that is accessible wherever the patient is. These records are more easily retrievable than manual systems, and can make a patient's navigation through the healthcare system much safer and more efficient. </p><p>But it's hardly a perfect world. Even though the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has made the promotion of a national, interoperable health information system a priority, EMRs have not been adopted nearly as quickly in the U.S. as one might expect. Issues, including the high cost, lack of standardization, security and privacy have stood in the way of  implementation. </p><p>A recent study from the New England Journal of Medicine points out that hospital EMR adoption rates are still abysmal, concluding that only about 8 percent of the 3,000 hospitals studied by researchers used even a basic EMR in a single unit, which included nurse or physician notes. And only 1.5 percent of non-federal U.S. facilities use a comprehensive EMR.</p><p>This seems counter-intuitive, especially when one considers the numerous advantages of EMRs, starting with efficiency. Information stored in an electronic format can be retrieved easily at the touch of a button or the click of a mouse. Search and retrieval times are a fraction of what they would be in manual systems. At the very least, this saves time by eliminating the need to complete the old manual medical history forms at a new physician's office. This also reduces the chance for error when a patient forgets to list certain prescribed medications or supplements. It's all there in one easily accessible record. </p><p>But efficiency isn't the only benefit. For patients, access to good care becomes easier and safer when records can easily be shared. Important information -- such as blood type, prescribed drugs, medical conditions and other medical history aspects -- can be accounted for much more quickly. Doctors and other medical personnel can retrieve these medical records from anywhere using handheld devices like an iPhone, which allows them to continue treatment no matter where they are. And, in case of emergency, information can be shared with emergency room physicians who can then order diagnostic tests and share results online. </p><p>Another benefit is safety. Remember that old joke about a doctor's indecipherable handwriting on prescription? It's not funny when you consider the seriousness of medical errors caused by today's possible powerful drug interactions. In fact, it's estimated that nearly 98,000 patients die annually by preventable medical errors of some type.  That's like two 737s crashing every day for a whole year. It's entirely possible that these numbers could be greatly reduced by a clearly readable prescription and/or comprehensive medical history information generated through an EMR system. </p><p>The Mayo Clinic is setting the standard for EMR implementation. With one of the largest such systems in the world, all medical documentation relating to a patient's care - physician notes, laboratory reports, surgical dictations, copies of correspondence, appointment schedules, X-rays, ultrasounds, CT and MRI scans, echocardiograms - is instantly available to caregivers via more than 16,000 computer terminals on Mayo's three campuses. The efficiencies created by simply typing a few identifying keystrokes to retrieve a patient's record -- as opposed to staring at thousands of file folders, filing and refiling them -- saves a doctor's practice or a hospital many thousands of dollars. That's even taking the cost of the electronic system into account. </p><p>Even the federal government thinks electronic record keeping is important. Veterans' hospitals across the country share an electronic system called VistA, which shares records of veterans in its health system. Should a patient find him- or herself in a VA hospital, even away from home, the hospital will have the same access to his or her records that the hometown hospital does. </p><p>It's interesting to note that a recent report from PricewaterhouseCoopers' Health Research Institute contends that Medicaid penalties might do more to boost EMR adoption than incentives, like available funding to physicians to purchase and implement EMRs. According to the report, &quot;Provisions in the stimulus law that call for cuts in Medicare reimbursements, rather than a multibillion-dollar incentive program, will do more to push the adoption of electronic medical records among hospitals and doctor practices by 2015.&quot; </p><p>However EMR adoption happens, it's critical that it happen sooner rather than later. The health care industry's ability to provide efficient, coordinated, safe and high-quality care is only enhanced by the rapid availability of accurate data. And with the availability of solid data, researchers can also use the EMR to analyze large amounts of patient information more efficiently, speeding the application of new research findings and vastly improving patient care in the future. </p><p>Just as Dr. Plummer saw beyond the information exchange limitations of his era, we can see the benefits of using the latest technologies for the practice of continuity in 21st century medicine. But the goal, just as it was in Dr. Plummer's time, or even going as far back as Hippocrates and his famous oath, is still nobly laudable: &quot;First, do no harm.&quot;  </p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,798,10/22/09 0:00,Wilkie honored with 2009 Vision Award,"Valleau Wilkie, Jr., executive vice president of the <a href=""http://www.sidrichardson.org/"">Sid W.

Today, 19 are on track to leave prostitution. </li><li>Preliminary evaluation suggests that the prostitutes abuse drugs (approximately 95 percent) for self-medication to address multiple mental health conditions and cope with risky behaviors. </li></ul><p>The program appears to be working.&nbsp; Findings show that the success of community organizations and public health agencies partnering with law enforcement agencies brings needed resources directly to the streets where a vulnerable population often experiences barriers to care.&nbsp; </p><p>The PDI will continue its monthly sting operations around the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and other cities are considering similar operations.&nbsp; For more information, go to <a href=""http://www.pdinewlife.org/"">http://www.pdinewlife.org/</a>.</p>",,,,,784,8/17/09 0:00,Putting Patients First,"<p>In addition to potential shortages in primary care specialties, the demand for specialists that provide care for patients over 65 will increase significantly. But by 2020, the number of cardiologists is expected to drop by 20 percent. The demand for oncologists is expected to grow by 48 percent over the next 10 years, but supply is only expected to grow by 14 percent. A staggering 58 percent of clinical genetic residencies go unfilled, and current demand for endocrinologists exceeds supply by 15 percent. And this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.</p><p>Recommendations include training 3,000 to 10,000 more physicians a year - over and above the current 25,000 trained per year- just to keep pace. But the number of first-year enrollees in U.S. medical schools has also declined steadily since 1980. Hardest hit is the field of primary care, as new physicians gravitate to more lucrative, less time-intensive practice areas. A 2005 <em>Academic Medicine</em> study found that only 27 percent of third-year internal medical residents planned to enter general internal medicine, a fall from 54 percent in 1998. Meanwhile, the number of Americans over age 65 is expected to double from 35 million today to 71 million by 2030, representing nearly one-fifth of the population and driving even more demand for primary care physicians. </p><p>This impending collision will inevitably result in poorer access to quality care, longer waits for appointments, shorter visits with doctors and a further erosion of our already-stressed health care system.&nbsp; The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) also notes that this shortage is likely to have an uneven effect, with some geographic areas, specialties and subpopulations hit harder than others, resulting in hardships for both poor urban and rural communities that are already hard hit. </p><p>And when you realize that it takes a good 10 years to train each new physician, it's obvious how far we are already behind the eight ball. Clearly, something needs to be done in order to assure a healthier and more productive workforce in tomorrow's economy. But what? </p><p>One answer: increase medical student enrollment and graduate medical education (GME), or residency, opportunities. The AAMC has already recommended a 30 percent increase in U.S. medical school enrollment and an expansion of GME positions to help solve the problem. But graduating more physicians, as we plan to do at the UNT Health Science Center, is just part of the solution. Keeping them in the state from which they graduate is key. As noted in the AAMC's report, &quot;2008 Physician Specialty Data,&quot; nearly 48 percent of physicians pursue GME opportunities, or residencies, in states other than those from which their medical schools are located. Here in Texas, the second-most populous state, we only rank 27<sup>th</sup> in the number of available GME slots. And since GME programs are expanding at just 4 percent in our state, we cannot expect that ranking to improve anytime soon. </p><p>Another set of solutions to the physician shortage: Improve efficiency, reconfigure the way some services are delivered and make better use of the physicians we already have. Consider the primary care system known as the &quot;advanced medical home&quot; - it's a comprehensive, one-stop network of resources that integrates the concept of the old-time family doctor with a whole-person approach to specialty care through networked teams of specialists in a collaborative environment. The result is a more efficient approach to health care than benefits both patient and physician in terms of efficient use of thin resources.</p><p>Still another solution is already underway: the retail health clinic, or oft-maligned &quot;doc-in-a-box&quot; concept. RHCs have risen in popularity for relatively minor ailments and injuries because they offer fast, convenient service during and outside regular office hours. In a recent <em>Tarrant County Physician</em> article, past-president of the Tarrant County Medical Society, Gary W. Floyd, MD, noted that RHSs have proliferated because &quot;(P)hysicians began dealing with insurance companies instead of our patients.&quot; He suggests that, rather than oppose the RHC trend, physicians consider establishing friendly relationships with local RHCs. The increased convenience and speed of care, as provided by properly supervised nurse practitioners and physician assistants at RHCs, could help patients avoid long waits for appointments while keeping the physician's status as the core medical home intact.</p><p>These are just a few of the many examples being cited as possible solutions to this crisis. Many more are in debate now. But one thing is sure: the discussions will be time-consuming, complex, fraught with politics and the situation will not yield quickly to either simple nostrums or convoluted legal maneuverings. Yet doing nothingis not an option. As seen by the success of RHCs, the marketplace is already doing something. It behooves us as business people to pay attention to this debate and ensure that our elected officials hear from us and support decisions that will return the focus of health care to where it should be: the patient. </p>",,,,,783,8/5/09 0:00,Grant funds DNA work in trafficking of children,"<p>Arthur Eisenberg, PhD, received a $500,000 grant from The Life Technologies Foundation to develop the <a href=""http://www.dna-prokids.org/"">DNA-PROKIDS Project</a>, &nbsp;an international humanitarian effort using DNA testing to deter human trafficking of children and help reunite abducted homeless children with their parents. </p><p>By establishing DNA registries of &nbsp;parents with a missing or abducted child, homeless children living on the streets or in shelters, and children in orphanages or illegal adoption centers throughout the world, PROKIDS intends to record the DNA identity of children most vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking -- whether that's prostitution, forced labor or militant activities, to illegal adoptions.</p><p>Eisenberg collaborated with Jose Lorente, a professor at the University of Granada in Spain, to establish &nbsp;a single worldwide DNA database.</p><p>The <a href=""http://www.lifetechnologies.com/"">Life Technologies Foundation</a> presented the award to the Health Science Center at a dinner hosted at the New York Academy of Sciences on June 11.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,782,7/22/09 0:00,Music & Medicine: Unique collaboration combines performing arts and science,"<p>When Eri Yoshimura begins to play, beautiful music fills the air. Her eyes close, and her body sways in time to the prelude. Her small hands glide over the keyboard gracefully, fluidly, as if they were tiny ballerinas on a miniature stage.</p><p>When she's not performing, though, this University of North Texas (UNT) piano performance doctoral student is part of a collaborative study between the Denton campus and the UNT Health Science Center designed to measure the benefits to a pianist's hands when using a special modified keyboard.&nbsp; This information can then be used to educate musicians who teach musicians and help prevent pianists - especially those with small hands - from developing pain caused by playing keyboards.</p><p>&quot;We're looking at hand function in piano players,&quot; said Rita Patterson, PhD, professor and director of the Osteopathic Heritage Foundation Physical Medicine Core Research Facility (OHFPMCRF). &quot;We've developed hardware and are collecting data on hand position and function while playing piano.&quot;</p><p>The study is funded by the Joint Institutional Seed Research Program, an intramural grant designed to foster collaborative, innovative research conducted jointly by UNT and the UNT Health Science Center faculty - in this case Patterson; Shrawan Kumar, PhD, OHFPMCRF professor; and Kris Chesky, PhD, director of UNT's Texas Center for Music and Medicine.</p><p>Yoshimura has studied piano-related pain among pianists in the past. She and Chesky published a paper in September 2006 concluding that 86 percent of college students majoring in piano experienced playing-related pain, with lack of flexibility and small hand span as contributors. This Joint Institutional Seed Research grant will allow PMI researchers to quantitatively measure what happens when a player sits down at a keyboard and begins to play.</p><p>One possible answer to alleviating the pain certain players feel while performing is the ergonomically modified Steinway piano that UNT students use in an effort to reduce such problems. The keyboard has narrower keys designed specifically for performers with smaller hands.</p><p>&quot;We're measuring hand size, hand position and how hard they're hitting the keys,&quot; Patterson said. &quot;Our technology will give us a thorough motion analysis as [the student subject] plays. There are 30 students, and we're gathering enough data to keep me busy for a long time. We can easily have two more dissertations worth of material.&quot;</p><p>Patterson said the researchers are using sensors on the players' hands that measure how far the hands must move to reach some of the chords common in piano pieces. Sensors under the piano keys measure how hard the player strikes the key while playing.</p><p>&quot;We're working on synching these systems properly,&quot; Patterson said. &quot;This will make the data easier to analyze.&quot;</p><p>Yoshimura has played on the modified keyboard in the past - her first concert on the new piano, also the first at UNT, was a performance in 2006 of the complete 24 Preludes by French composer Claude Debussy.</p><p>&quot;We are the first school to offer this [modified keyboard] to students,&quot; Chesky said. &quot;It's a major departure from the norm and hugely significant because many people pursuing piano at the college level are Asian females. But this population has smaller hands than the average male, for whom standard pianos were designed. </p><p>&quot;It's like someone who is used to driving a 1987 Impala suddenly getting into a Ferrari. They just have much more flexibility and ease of playing. It's really quite remarkable.&quot;</p><p>Yoshimura, who came to UNT from Osaka, Japan, 10 years ago to pursue a second bachelor's degree in music, a master's degree and now a doctoral degree, said traditionally sized keyboards do cause her pain.</p><p>&quot;I have very small hands. When I span a chord or octave, I have to stretch my hands a lot, so I feel the tension in my arms,&quot; Yoshimura said. &quot;There are many pieces with big chords, so the repertoire I can play is limited.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Musicians are like athletes: they're highly motivated, and they won't tell you when they're in pain,&quot; Patterson said. &quot;They just keep playing. Dr. Chesky has found that the repetitive use of certain muscles, hunching over, playing 24/7, causes musculoskeletal problems. We've partnered to look at this. Hopefully we'll have a long history together.&quot;</p><p>This dual-campus project has since grown, though, to include a third. George Kondraske, PhD, professor of electrical and biomedical engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington and founding director of UTA's Human Performance Institute, is joining the investigation.</p><p>Patterson said she had heard of Chesky's work with musicians, studies for which Kondraske had fashioned hardware.&nbsp; </p><p>&quot;Dr. Kondraske modified what Dr. Chesky had to fit our needs,&quot; she said. &quot;Because we both have history with him, we're rolling him into this project, and he will be included in any proposals for additional funding.&quot;</p><p>Patterson said despite the distance between the three campuses, the study has proved to be a productive partnership.</p><p>&quot;If you have competent people on each end, it works,&quot; she said. &quot;We've been to the Denton campus a couple of times to see the data collection. And e-mail's great.&quot; </p><p>The team hopes to continue this pilot program with more grants.</p><p>&quot;We'll probably have enough data with this initial study to publish, but it's absolutely crucial that we expand this study and apply for federal funding,&quot; she said. </p>",,,,,781,7/20/09 0:00,Want Health Reform? Stay Well!,"As usual, Ben Franklin was right when he said, &quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&quot; In those 10 small words, he encapsulated everything we need to know about better health. But sadly, as a nation, we've failed to listen. And now this advice may lie at the heart of health reform.<p>Our people are fat and getting fatter. The toll of this trend--diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and some cancers-- is needless loss of life and a financial impact of more than $2 trillion a year in health care - almost 50 percent more per person than the next most costly nation. An estimated 75 percent of those health care costs go to treat chronic, conditions including heart disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, breast cancer and obesity, which are all largely preventable by changes in nutrition, physical activity and lifestyle. </p><p>Yet for all this spending, the quality of our care is often lower, and we aren't any healthier. In fact, citizens in some countries that spend less than we do actually are living longer. </p><p>If Ben were still around, he'd surely be appalled. </p><p>In a nutshell, our problem is that our health care system is built on the concept of providing disease care, not wellness care. We reward fixing what's gone wrong, rather than rewarding behaviors that prevent things from going wrong in the first place. Study after study shows that preventive measures like a better diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation and stress reduction programs can have a positive effect on health and even reduce and reverse the progress of chronic disease. </p><p>Those positive results aren't news to those who believe in the benefits of osteopathic medicine. Back in 1870, the discipline's founder, Dr. Andrew Still, promoted the idea that physicians should focus on treating the whole patient, rather than just the disease. He recognized the body's ability to heal itself and stressed preventive medicine, eating properly and keeping fit. He also eschewed the use of drugs common to the day, many of which were worthless &quot;patent&quot; medicines.</p><p>America's 60,000 DOs (Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine) make up just 8 percent of the nation's total number of practicing doctors. But that balance is beginning to shift, as nearly 20 percent of today's medical students choose osteopathic medicine, compared to just 5 percent nearly 30 years ago. And the increasing awareness about prevention as well as primary care is promoting greater overlap between the two philosophies, proving that what's good for the medical profession is also good for the patient. </p><p>Today's Americans stand to benefit from this increased synergy, especially the theme of prevention, when you consider that an estimated 40 percent of premature deaths are caused by lifestyle choices like poor eating habits, smoking and inactivity. </p><p>Prevention was also the major theme in the recent &quot;Health&quot; issue of Time magazine (June 22, 2009), which cited the 1,100-bed Cleveland Clinic as a model of high quality care based on the concept of wellness. Dr. Delos Cosgrove, CEO of Cleveland Clinic, believes that healthy behavior should be rewarded and people should think about health as a self-responsibility and an investment. </p><p>The idea of wellness as an investment makes sense. After all, sick employees cost employers in terms of higher insurance premiums, sick days and lower productivity. Conversely, by preventing preventable diseases, we could save billions ... plus save lives. </p><p>In a speech on June 15 to the American Medical Association, President Obama said, &quot;Building a health care system that promotes prevention rather than just managing diseases will require all of us to do our part.&quot; As physicians, we must do our part by telling patients about risk factors to avoid and what preventive measures to pursue. Employers can do their part by creating wellness programs that reward workers for taking better care of their health while reducing health care costs in the process.

Nothing can be more important to a state than its public health: The state's paramount concern should be the health of its people.&quot; </p><p>Since FDR's time, overall health and life expectancy have improved greatly for most Americans. However, the former president's words still ring true in communities throughout America, where too many citizens are not receiving the full benefits of better health. The term for this imbalance is called &quot;health disparities,&quot; defined by the American Public Health Association as &quot;differences in health status between people that are related to social or demographic factors such as race, gender, income or geographic region.&quot; </p><p>Numerous studies, too detailed to explore in this forum, convincingly demonstrate solid evidence that race and ethnicity correlate with persistent and increasing health disparities, mainly due to availability and quality of care as associated with an individual's economic status, race and gender. According to a research article in the June 2004 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, &quot;Substantial evidence indicates that disparities in health status in the U.S. result largely from longstanding, pervasive racial and ethnic discrimination.&quot; In fact, according to APHA, people of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds experience higher rates of a variety of diseases and health conditions than Caucasian Americans. For example, twice as many African-American, American Indians and Alaskan Native infants die before one year of age than their white counterparts.</p><p>According to Dr. Kathryn Cardarelli, director of the Center for Community Health at the UNT Health Science Center, infant mortality is one of the most significant measurements of health disparities, as well as a powerful marker of a community's overall health. Unfortunately, the North Texas region has some of the highest infant mortality rates among all large Texas cities.&nbsp; In 2005 (the most recent data year), Fort Worth's infant mortality rate was 8.1 per 1,000 live births, the highest for all large Texas cities. And in mid-size to large cities, Arlington took the No. 1 slot in Texas. I think we can all agree that these rankings are nothing short of dismal.</p><p>When companies and businesses look to establish themselves or relocate, one of their first parameters for desirability is community health. Similarly, the cost of health disparities is transferred throughout the health system and ultimately increases the cost of insurance and health care services to business.&nbsp; All said, health disparities are directly and indirectly a major issue for business.&nbsp; With our rankings, we are hurting ourselves both in terms of a happier, healthier community and in a very real business development sense. The situation is deplorable, given our depth of world-class medical capabilities and institutions.</p><p>There's no silver bullet to resolve this situation. But given that health disparity issues are not predominately genetic but socioeconomic, we can take measures to change policies that affect socioeconomic issues and can, therefore, improve domestic health outcomes. </p><p>On a national level, since most Americans are unaware that there is a health disparity issue, we can educate and build awareness. The people of this country are willing to help their fellow citizens, as long as they understand the issue. A long-term strategic approach to research and intervention, integrating industry, academics and local community groups, will yield positive benefits. And current programs that successfully combat health disparities, like the CDC's REACH 2010 (Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health 2010) can and should be replicated and implemented in target populations. </p><p>Again, there are no simple solutions. But it's abundantly clear that where there's a will, there's a way. FDR recognized the problems more than five decades ago, and significant strides were made to address the challenges of his era. That same commitment of will can have an equally salutary effect on our nation's health now, as well as build a foundation for a healthier </p><p>future. </p><p>Scott Ransom is president and professor in obstetrics, </p><p>gynecology, health management and policy at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.</p>",,,,,773,6/9/09 0:00,Cardarelli and Sorrells named to 40 Under 40,"<p>Kathryn Cardarelli, PhD, MPH, assistant professor of Epidemiology, and Brent Sorrells,<strong> </strong>associate director of entrepreneurship for TECH Fort Worth, were named to <em>Fort Worth Business Press' </em>2009 40 Under 40 list, featuring 40 Tarrant County business and community leaders under the age of 40.

This month, I'd like to propose some cost-effective solutions. By taking significant action on two important fronts, I believe we can provide universal coverage with just a nominal increase in total national spending. First, we must build improvements into the U.S.'s current mixed private-public system. Second, we must invest in better technology to improve efficiency across the breadth of this revised health care system.</p><p>President Obama's administration has proposed a plan that addresses these two important issues. Improving the current mixed public-private system will include maintaining the current role of employer-sponsored insurance while providing for an expanded Medicare system. A significant new entity, the National Health Insurance Exchange, will connect the two systems and help individuals acquire new, affordable health care options if they are uninsured or want new insurance. Income-based sliding scale tax credits will be provided for those who need it, to ensure thorough coverage. </p><p>A vitally important element of this proposal guarantees eligibility and covers pre-existing conditions. As a result, everyone, regardless of health status and/or history, will have access to comprehensive benefits at fair prices. This is a significant change in philosophy from our current system, which denies coverage to many applicants with pre-existing chronic conditions. Many uninsured simply opt for no treatment until a crisis happens, and then they resort to using emergency rooms as clinics, further stressing an already stressed ER system, and driving treatment costs far above what they would have been had the pre-existing condition been treated properly from day one.</p><p>The second element of this plan aims to improve efficiency across the health care system. Providers in other countries have plugged into the latest e-sharing technologies, but many of our nation's caregivers still rely on hand-scrawled notes. Standardized electronic health information systems will help providers coordinate care, measure quality and reduce errors, with plenty of room for encryption codes to ensure patient privacy.&nbsp; A study by the Rand Corporation found that if most hospitals and doctors adopted electronic health records, up to $77 billion of savings would result. </p><p>Another significant part of the plan allows flexibility for state health reform plans. Several states have taken lessons from Switzerland and the Netherlands, which both offer successful examples of standardized benefits plans combined with tight regulation of insurance markets. Massachusetts, for example, has already adopted some of these concepts, and alternative options are being considered by other states and federal policymakers. Allowing states to continue exploring alternatives helps build a groundswell of innovation that is desperately needed to help our system become more competitive and efficient. </p><p>One such innovation is the &quot;medical home,&quot; which integrates the concept of the old-time family doctor with a whole-person approach to specialty care through networked teams of specialists in a collaborative environment. Led by a patient's personal physician, a team of individuals at the practice level collectively takes responsibility for a patient's ongoing care, including all stages of life: acute care; chronic care; preventive services; and end of life care. By integrating all elements of the health care system (e.g., subspecialty care, hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes) with the patient's community (e.g., family, public and private community-based services), we achieve a far more logical flow of care than today's expensive, fragmented, specialty approach.</p><p>My point is that, as business people, we should be on the front lines of the struggle to improve our bloated, overly-complex health care system. We should be willing to support an open and ongoing conversation on how to reduce projected trends in health spending.&nbsp; Why? Because the consequences of ever-soaring costs, combined with eroding coverage, can and should not be allowed to overwhelm our economy, especially when viable solutions are possible.</p>",,,,,767,5/11/09 0:00,Commencement is May 16 at Ft.

Nearly 40 years later, his vision is still out of reach. Had he lived, Lennon would now be pushing 70, and it's not hard to imagine him turning his artistic sensibilities (and biting wit) to the state of health care in his adopted country. What, I wonder, would he make of a World Health Organization (WHO) report that sandwiches U.S. health outcomes between those of Costa Rica and Slovenia?&nbsp; </p><p>&quot;Help,&quot; indeed. </p><p>In the above-mentioned WHO-sponsored ranking, France and Italy took top honors for health outcomes, while the U.S. came in well down the list at 37<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; More recently, the highly regarded Commonwealth Fund - a private foundation that promotes a high-performing health care system - issued a report ranking the U.S. last or next to last compared with Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The report's parameters included quality, access to care, patient safety, efficiency and equity. The only area where the U.S. comes out on top is in cost: we pay more for health care per person, with fewer people covered, than any other advanced nation.</p><p>The greatest disparity between the U.S. and these other countries is the lack of universal health insurance coverage. All other major industrialized nations provide such coverage, and most have comprehensive benefits packages with no cost-sharing. Meanwhile, nearly 45 million of America's citizens have no coverage at a given time and over 70 million Americans do not have health insurance at least part of the year.&nbsp; Equally troubling is that millions more Americans are underinsured. As a result, these individuals either go without care until a minor illness turns major, or fill up hospital emergency rooms for routine care. This stresses an already overburdened system to perform services it was never designed for, resulting in declining access for true emergency services, especially on nights and weekends. </p><p>Perhaps most shocking, America ranks dead last on almost all equity measures because of a huge disparity between quality of care given to richer and poorer citizens. In 2005, two-fifths of adults with below-average incomes went without needed care. They simply couldn't spend money they didn't have on doctor visits, tests and pharmaceuticals. To my mind, never has the phrase, &quot;You get what you pay for,&quot; been more repellent.</p><p>However, there are some bright spots: we earn high marks in technology and innovation and we've also done better than most industrialized countries in reducing smoking. And most insured Americans get speedier service than their international counterparts when it comes to seeing a specialist or undergoing elective surgery. </p><p>But we rank last among 23 nations in infant mortality; near the bottom in healthy life expectancy at age 60; and 15<sup>th</sup> among 19 in deaths from a wide range of illnesses that would not have been fatal if treated in a timely and effective manner. Plus, our well-publicized obesity problem continues to spiral out of control. And as health care providers in other countries plug into the latest e-sharing technologies, many of our caregivers still rely on hand-scrawled notes pigeonholed in manila folders, thus limiting information access and better coordinated care. </p><p>Clearly, our first task is to reduce the enormous number of uninsured, alleviating a major reason for our poor standings on so many levels. The new administration is looking to other countries for best-practice examples of reducing uninsured levels while providing high-quality health care delivery, coordination and equity.&nbsp; Switzerland and the Netherlands both offer interesting examples of standardized benefits plans combined with tight regulation of insurance markets. In fact, some of these same concepts have been adopted by Massachusetts and are being considered by other states and federal policymakers. </p><p>Still, much remains to be done to lift our system above those of Chile and Morocco (33<sup>rd</sup> and 29<sup>th</sup>, respectively). To be fair, our country is larger and has more complex requirements than these smaller nations. But if countries with fewer resources can develop successful methods to give all their citizens high-quality health care, then surely we can, too. Peace, love and understanding may have been John Lennon's utopia, but there's always hope. As long as we have hope, we can imagine ways to better and more equitable health care for all. And if we can imagine it, we can do it.</p><p><em>Scott Ransom is president and professor in obstetrics, gynecology, health management and policy at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.</em></p>",,,,,759,4/17/09 0:00,Dr. Vicki Nejtek featured on NPR's All Things Considered,"<p>Dr. Vicki Nejtek, associate professor of Psychology and Human Behavior,&nbsp;was quoted as part&nbsp;of a scenario on National Public Radio's <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=2"">All Things Considered</a> on April 20.

Just a few generations ago, diseases like tuberculosis, smallpox and polio crippled and killed millions. Today, thanks to pioneering research, they're almost non-existent and the benefits are obvious, both in terms of healthier worldwide populations and attendant increases in productivity. And as new therapies reduce the number of patients needing treatment and lower the overall cost of per-patient treatment, social benefits accrue exponentially.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To evaluate the economic value of medical research to society, we might begin by defining two broad categories: &quot;clinical research,&quot; the evaluation of new treatments for safety and efficacy in clinical trials with patients; and &quot;translational research,&quot; which combines basic laboratory research (theory and animal experiments) with clinical research results and contributes to the development of new treatments. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And at the risk of blowing our own horn, I think that Tarrant County can take justifiable pride in the fact that the UNT Health Science Center excels at both types of research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, earlier this month the UNT Health Science Center celebrated its 17<sup>th</sup> Annual Research Appreciation Day (RAD), an institutional tradition encompassing medicine, public health and basic science. The event featured nearly 200 research projects on a wide range of heath issues including aging, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, vision, osteopathic manipulative medicine, physical medicine, women's health, public health and infectious diseases. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This research, invaluable in its own right, is also an economic spark plug:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, every $1 spent on scientific research returns $2.49 to the Texas economy.&nbsp; Last year, UNT Health Science Center received $32 million in research funding, which clearly adds up to a significant economic impact.&nbsp; Much of the funding for this research comes from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which, even as overall NIH budgets have stagnated, represents a tripling of research dollars to the UNT Health Science Center over the past eight years.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Significant as they are, these figures don't count intangible benefits. Universities with a healthy research budget are more likely to increase enrollment by attracting the brightest students and are also more likely to form partnerships with think tanks - pumping still more money into the economy.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Health care providers affiliated with research facilities that conduct clinical trials have ready access to these research discoveries, which translate into better medical services for patients.&nbsp; Communities with superior health care benefit from a healthier work force, higher productivity and better quality of life.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if findings stay in the lab, nobody benefits.&nbsp; That's why TECH Fort Worth Acceleration Lab, a public-private partnership designed to support start-up companies built on emerging technology, is helping bring these discoveries into the real world where they benefit all.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Dan Petty, president of the North Texas Commission, points out, &quot;The North Texas Commission is strongly in favor of more scientific research that could lead to commercialization. In fact our chairman, Ken Barr, has led our board to establish an Innovation Committee of the North Texas Commission. The committee will be led by Wes Jurey, president of the Arlington Chamber and a leader in innovation activities in the North Texas Region.&nbsp; The North Texas Commission is squarely behind these efforts, that, if successful, will benefit greatly the economic vitality and quality of life for our region.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Former Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr agrees. In his role as chairman for the regional non-profit North Texas Commission, he firmly believes in the power of medical research to promote economic vitality in our area. &quot;Successful &lsquo;innovation economies' result from partnerships between universities and the private sector, especially when they focus on technology transfer from the lab to the marketplace.&quot; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So I think it's fair to say that medical research certainly is capable of delivering business economic returns in the form of new patents, groundbreaking pharmaceuticals and treatment options that generate long-term dividends. But the greatest and most profound dividends are those that encompass long-term health solutions, in the form of a smiling child who has beaten cancer, or any patient who has benefited from new methods of healing and care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Scott Ransom is president and professor in obstetrics, gynecology, health management and policy at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.</em></p>",,,,,746,3/13/09 0:00,"Unemployment, Health Care Spending Affect Mortality","<p>&nbsp;</p><p>At&nbsp;the Health Industries Council meeting on March 11, in Irving, Harvey Brenner, PhD and professor of public health and behavioral sciences at the University of North Texas Health Science Center's School of Public Health, announced new findings that indicate that mortality is directly related to the economy.&nbsp; Specifically, unemployment and reduced spending on health care have a direct effect on the country's mortality rate.</p><p>&quot;We have seen this correlation in cardiovascular disease,&quot; Brenner related.&nbsp; &quot;But these are the first findings that show a direct correlation between reduced health care expenditures and reduced labor force participation on increases in mortality.&quot;</p><p>Since World War II, research literature has shown that economic development is good for health in developing countries.&nbsp; However, it isn't clear if this same economic development in already developed countries has the same benefits.&nbsp; In fact, Brenner's research shows that unemployment is a much more important factor in health and well-being than economic development.&nbsp; </p><p>&quot;Interestingly, this economic downturn is showing how quickly the effects of unemployment and, thus, reduction of health care expenditures is resulting in mortality,&quot; Brenner said.&nbsp; &quot;In the past, we saw people die within 10 years after their job loss.&nbsp; Now, we are seeing them die as early as the same year.&quot;</p><p>When a worker becomes unemployed, he or she often loses health insurance, suffers stress and adopts unhealthy behavior as a result.&nbsp; They may delay preventive health care because of the cost or loss of health insurance coverage.&nbsp; The stress of being unemployed causes both physical and psychological issues that may eventually erupt into major medical conditions that easily could have been treated earlier. </p><p>The bottom line is, preventing and controlling health issues is more important in a down economy as more and more people struggle to balance the need for food, shelter and health care.</p><p>&nbsp;Read the <a href=""http://economywatchblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/03/recession-and-death.html"">Dallas Morning News article</a> about Brenner's findings.</p>",,,,,745,3/5/09 0:00,Tee-Up for 4th annual President‰Ûªs Invitational Golf Tournament April 7,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's time to wipe the dust off the golf clubs and get ready for the 4th annual UNT Health Science Center President's Invitational Golf Tournament, to be held April 7 at <a href=""http://www.ridgleacountryclub.com/"">Ridglea's Championship Course</a>. &nbsp;There is still time to <a href=""../../invitationalregistration/"">register</a> for the tournament.

In a perfect world, a manufacturer makes the right product in the right quantity and consumers buy at the right price. Voila, equilibrium! </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But it's hardly perfect out there. Our domestic automotive industry is a supply-and-demand equation that's painfully out of balance. Another is health care: specifically, the growing imbalance between physicians and the expanding population they serve, especially here in Texas. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to a recent briefing document prepared for the 81<sup>st</sup> Texas Legislature called the &quot;2009 Medical Education and Physician Workforce Consensus Statement,&quot; Texas ranks 43<sup>rd</sup> in physician-to-population ratios in a state-by-state comparison. Even though the report notes that &quot;[n]ew physicians have been added to the Texas workforce in record-high numbers since 2003, [but] these gains, although significant, are failing to meet growing demand.&quot; The document also says that Texas faces a shortage of physicians across virtually all medical specialties that's expected to worsen over the next decade. (The briefing was assembled with input from the state's nine medical schools, two health-related institutions, and state teaching and children's hospital and medical associations). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we simply increase the medical student supply, we should be able to meet growing demand and solve the problem. The projections seem to bear this out: Texas led the nation in population gains in 2005 and 2006 and is projected to grow 21 percent by 2015. Medical school enrollments in Texas are expected to grow 30 percent during the same period. So the indicators seem to point to an adequate supply of physicians that will adequately serve the demands of an ever-expanding population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But as noted, it's hardly a perfect world. The rub is that while medical school enrollments are growing, opportunities in graduate medical education (GME) are not. (GME includes residencies and fellowships in teaching hospitals and academic health centers). Simply put, medical school prepares a physician for entrance into a GME program, not for direct entry into medical practice. If Texas lacks an adequate supply of GME opportunities, then students will be forced to go outside the state to complete their residencies and possibly begin practice. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And that's exactly what's happening. Texas is the second-most populous state (behind California) and is currently seeing a healthy expansion of medical school students (25 percent). But we're only ranked 27<sup>th</sup> in the number of available GME slots. And since GME programs are expanding in Texas at barely 4 percent, it is clear that we do not have nearly enough places for these students to go, in order to hone their skills and talents. (Right here in Tarrant County, the number of residency slots has remained flat and actually reduced in some areas).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To quote directly from the document's findings: &quot;Texas medical school enrollments are growing more quickly than GME programs. Unless GME programs expand, Texas will lose medical school graduates, as well as the state's investment in their medical education, to other states.&quot; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cost is not insignificant. Each graduate who leaves the state to practice elsewhere represents a net loss of more than $200,000 in state funding. The state also forfeits the economic benefit that a physician's practice brings to a community, estimated at an average of $750,000 a year per practice. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The solution is classic supply-and-demand: align GME growth with medical school expansions. Easy to say, but as any economics major will attest, not nearly as easy to do. Expanding GME pipelines, along with pipelines for more medical students to offset the impending physician shortage, will call for direct investment from the state into programs that provide real, long-lasting opportunities for our students and keep them in Texas, where they can provide for the needs of an increasing population with the latest medical knowledge and preparation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Locally, we're fortunate to have several outstanding hospitals with the potential to develop new GME opportunities. However, this will create a shift in our longstanding culture of supply: namely, our over-reliance on recruiting physicians from other communities across the country.&nbsp; But the upside will be a much better ability to serve ever-increasing population demands with a home-grown supply of physicians who are committed to living and working in Texas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Medical students who complete both medical school and residency training in Texas are three times more likely to stay and practice in the Lone Star State. As business leaders, we must insist upon improving the GME opportunities for our medical students to stay in Texas and build their careers. We have the necessary infrastructure and a ready source of fledgling physicians: all we need is the strength of will to make the necessary changes to our theory of supply. The dividends include better health for our citizens and a healthy, competitive workforce for the future. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we do not work with our political leaders to expand GME opportunities in Texas, we are committing ourselves to the medical educational equivalent of short-term mortgages that will jeopardize our future well-being, both economically and from a health perspective. And that's no theory. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Scott Ransom is president and professor in obstetrics, gynecology, health management and policy at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.&nbsp; </em></p>",,,,,740,2/11/09 0:00,Religion improves mental and physical health,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Church-based social support networks may help improve mental and physical health, according to a study conducted by Dr. Elena Bastida.

But with the economy mired in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and policy makers focusing on righting the ship, enacting meaningful reform quickly might seem unlikely. </p><p>As business leaders, we should encourage health care reform. Simply doing nothing about health care is not an option anymore. The United States has the most expensive health care system in the world per capita, but lags behind most developed countries in virtually every health statistic worth mentioning, including life expectancy at birth. America's infant mortality rate is 6.8 per 1,000 births - more than twice as high as Japan, Sweden and Norway. In fact, too many American children receive too little medical attention. A UNICEF study ranks the United States second to last among 21 developed nations for child well being. </p><p>The situation is getting worse, not better, especially here in Texas, where our health rankings have dropped dramatically in just the past year. According to America's Health Rankings 2008, an annual report published through a partnership between United Health Foundation, the American Public Health Association and Partners for Prevention, our state dropped to 46th place from 37th last year, the biggest drop by any state. We also have an inordinately high rate of uninsured (25 percent as compared to the national average of 15.5 percent), a high incidence of infectious disease, limited access to primary care and a high percentage of children living in poverty. The report concludes that, in Texas, &quot;overall healthiness may remain low in future years.&quot;&nbsp; </p><p>So what's the answer? On one hand, many business leaders fear expensive government-run health care funded by higher taxes. On the other hand, average Americans fear allowing insurance and pharmaceutical companies to operate with fewer rules and regulations. </p><p>Containing rising medical costs and insurance premiums, while ensuring that employers aren't the only ones footing the bill, are essential elements of any health care reform plan. So is revising coverage rules about pre-existing conditions. But reformers point out that any proposal must require a mandate that everyone have health coverage - much like all motorists must buy car insurance. Spreading the cost of health care coverage will make sure that one group doesn't have to shoulder the burden. Ideally, such a program will ease the burden for businesses and ensure that they won't have to cut costs and/or be unable to add jobs. </p><p>Part of Obama's proposed plan calls for improving the use of technology in the administration of medical information. This effort will pay dividends in two areas: overhead costs will be reduced and quality of health care will improve. The Mayo Clinic, the Geisinger Clinic in Pennsylvania and the Cleveland Clinic are shining examples of how costs can be contained while the quality of care improves. The plan also calls for a more intense focus on the prevention and management of chronic diseases, which has the real potential to dramatically improve health outcomes. &nbsp;</p><p>From a moral point of view, reforming the broken system and making health care available to everyone is the right thing to do. But it won't be easy or quick. At 17 percent of gross domestic product, health care costs are the biggest sector of the economy and are expected to grow to 25 percent by 2025. Turning such a massive ship will take time and real leadership. </p><p>But beginning the process is absolutely vital to restoring our overall economic health and well-being. Workers who lack health insurance or have limited access to health care due to cost simply go without, relying instead on taxpayer-funded emergency room treatment for illnesses. It doesn't take a genius to know that those in poor health or with chronic diseases, who simply do without proper medical attention due to cost and accessibility, are more likely to miss work and be less productive on the job than their healthier counterparts. </p><p>As business leaders, we must take active ownership of the reform process to ensure that accessible health care for all Americans remains a priority without disrupting the profitability of businesses. We have a voice in this new administration, and we can use it to help our new president with fresh ideas, initiatives and concepts to fix the situation before it's too late. </p><p>Dr. Scott Ransom is president and professor in obstetrics, gynecology, health management and policy at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.

Her grant is part of the largest commitment of breast cancer research funding by a single nonprofit organization. The funding is targeted to 81 universities and hospitals in 27 states and five countries. These grants represent research with the highest likelihood of producing results for patients during the next decade.<p>&quot;There's a tremendous urgency to translate what we're learning in the lab into treatments for patients, particularly patients with very aggressive cancers who don't have years to wait,&quot; said Dr. Eric P. Winer, chief scientific advisor to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and director of the Breast Oncology Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.</p><p>&quot;The grants we are funding focus on safely and effectively bringing treatments to cancer patients in a more timely way than we have been able to in the past,&quot; Winer added.</p><p>&quot;We've revamped Komen's research program, challenging the best minds to solve the most difficult issues in breast cancer,&quot; said Hala Moddelmog, president and CEO of Susan G. Komen for the Cure. &quot;These grants are geared to results - finding cures, tailoring treatments and resolving the issues that have stymied the search for a breast cancer cure.&quot;</p><p>Some of the biggest questions to be tackled by the Komen-funded research include:</p><p>    * Why do some breast cancers respond to certain treatments, and others don't?<br />    * How can we prevent the spread of breast cancer to other organs?<br />    * Does diet and/or obesity play a role in cancer development and treatment?<br />    * Can we predict who is most at risk for developing breast cancer?<br />    * Can we develop a cancer vaccine?<br />    * What technologies will help detect breast cancer at its earliest possible stage?<br />    * What treatments can prolong the lives of those women living with advanced breast cancer?</p><p>During the past 25 years, Komen for the Cure has raised and distributed $1.2 billion for research and community health programs. And Komen is pledging to invest another $2 billion during the next 10 years.</p><p>This year, Komen introduces new research programs called Promise Grants, which are worth millions of dollars and last for five years. They are designed to get scientists and doctors to work together in new ways to bring treatments out of the laboratory to patients as quickly as possible. Komen also is funding new and bigger grants to attract and retain young cancer researchers.</p><p>Moddelmog noted that research and awareness funding has helped ease suffering from breast cancer. &quot;In the past 20 years, we've gone from a time when breast cancer was not even discussed, to a new era with higher survivor rates and less invasive treatments than existed even just a decade ago,&quot; Moddelmog said.</p><p>&quot;Even so, we have so much more to do. Almost 200,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the U.S. this year and more than 40,000 women and men will die of this disease. That adds urgency to our mission to end breast cancer forever.&quot;</p><p>The Komen grants undergo a rigorous peer-review process by groups of laboratory scientists, clinicians and advocates. These grants fall into the following categories:</p><p>    * Promise Grants: Large-scale grants, up to $7.5 million each during a five-year period, targeted to research that brings science to the bedside quicker than ever before. Komen will provide $35 million in Promise grants to seven, multi-year projects in 2008.<br />    * Post-Doctoral Research: Grants of $60,000 per year to attract and retain promising young researchers nationwide and internationally. Forty-six scientists will share grant funding that totals $7.7 million over three years.<br />    * Career Catalyst Research: Grants of $150,000 per year for three years to fill a critical gap in support and stimulate the transition from training to independence among promising cancer investigators. Total funding: $10.9 million to 26 researchers.<br />    * Investigator Initiated Research: Grants of up to $200,000 per year for three years to explore new ideas and approaches leading to reductions in breast cancer mortality and/or the incidence within the decade. Total funding: $35.3 million for 60 grants.<br />    * Affiliate Grants: Special grants co-funded by 15 Komen Affiliates to institutions in their hometowns or states.</p><p>In addition, Komen has directed $13 million to other cancer research organizations to fund collaborative projects. A complete list of the grants can be found on www.komen.org/grants.</p><p>About Susan G. Komen for the Cure&reg;</p><p>Nancy G. Brinker promised her dying sister, Susan G. Komen, she would do everything in her power to end breast cancer forever. In 1982, that promise became Susan G. Komen for the Cure and launched the global breast cancer movement. Today, Komen for the Cure is the world's largest grassroots network of breast cancer survivors and activists fighting to save lives, empower people, ensure quality care for all and energize science to find the cures. Thanks to events like the Komen Race for the Cure Series, we have invested more than $1.2 billion to fulfill our promise, becoming the largest source of nonprofit funds dedicated to the fight against breast cancer in the world.

åÊ

In the wake of the storm, thousands of victims were left with questions ‰ÛÓ where do I go? What do I do? Where can I eat and sleep?<br><br>

åÊ

But for some, the most harrowing question of all was the one that needed the quickest answer ‰ÛÓ where is my missing loved one?<br><br>

åÊ

‰ÛÏAs soon as I heard Katrina had hit right there, I got together with Steve (Gammon) and Linda LaRose to make sure we had everything together ‰ÛÓ DNA reference sample collection kits and ready to mail out to anyone who asked for them,‰Û said George Adams, program project manager for the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification. ‰ÛÏWe were ready to go in under 24 hours.‰Û<br><br>

åÊ

The lab‰Ûªs quick action was a relief to Deedra Hughes, DNA technical leader for the Mississippi Crime Lab in Jackson, Miss., who said the disaster left her to answer questions from people who were missing loved ones.<br><br>

åÊ

The fated day<br><br>

åÊ

‰ÛÏThat first day, I was here, and it was constant phone calls coming in ‰ÛÓ ‰Û÷What do we do? Where do we give samples?‰Ûª‰Û Hughes said. ‰ÛÏIt was heartbreaking. I was here crying on the phone because the calls didn‰Ûªt stop. <br><br>
‰ÛÏAll of our agencies were searching and collecting bodies before they deteriorated. We had no idea who was going to do the testing and identification or how it was going to get done.<br><br>

åÊ

‰ÛÏThe state of Mississippi does not have a DNA collection kit in place. We don‰Ûªt have anything for collecting remains for DNA identification. We didn‰Ûªt have time to piecemeal a kit or purchase what we needed for kits. That wasn‰Ûªt an option.‰Û<br><br>

åÊ

UNTCHI steps in to help<br><br>

åÊ

When Adams called and let Hughes know the kits were ready to be sent, she said she asked for them immediately.<br><br>

åÊ

‰ÛÏThey (the Center for Human Identification at the UNT Health Science Center) stepped in and said, ‰Û÷Hey, we‰Ûªre here,‰Ûª‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏI was overwhelmed. It was a burden lifted to know the kits were there and were ready and uniform. And to pick up the phone and have a contact ‰ÛÓ to have George ‰ÛÓ was just such a relief. They stepped in when it was total chaos and made it easier.‰Û<br><br>

åÊSamples from 389åÊpersons missing from Mississippi were sent to UNTCHI, and all of the DNA analysis for them was done free of charge ‰ÛÓ the testing was funded by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ).<br><br>

åÊ

‰ÛÏMississippi was the only state who took us up on the offer for DNA kits,‰Û Adams said. ‰ÛÏDeedra collected the samples and sent them to us, and we turned them around in short order under direction of the NIJ. They told us to make these cases top priority.‰Û<br><br>

åÊ

Hughes said people in the DNA lab also made themselves available to help her answer questions for the families waiting to hear about missing loved ones.<br><br>

åÊ

‰ÛÏI called after hours. I called on Saturdays. I left messages for Artie (Eisenberg, director of the DNA Lab),‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏWe had upset family members who wanted testing rushed, so I would call the Center and apologize because we didn‰Ûªt want to bother them, but asking, ‰Û÷Is there any way you could rush this?‰Ûª They were right on top of it. Not one time did they say ‰Û÷no‰Ûª to anythingåÊthat we asked. It was just such a relief.‰Û<br><br>

åÊ

Hurricane Katrina killed nearly 2,000 people in Mississippi and Louisiana.<br><br>

åÊ

In case it happens again<br><br>

åÊ

Adams said the lab always has 1,000 DNA sample collection kits on hand for just such a disaster, should something similar happen.<br><br>

åÊ

‰ÛÏWe try to keep an inventory for a mass disaster,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏWe can send them anywhere in the country ‰ÛÓ we should be able to respond as long as we have an address to send them to. As soon as a natural disaster hits, we‰Ûªre ready to roll anywhere in the country.‰Û<br><br>

åÊ

Hughes said she finds the UNTCHI‰Ûªs willingness to help at such times a comfort.<br><br>
åÊ‰ÛÏI don‰Ûªt know how they get their funding, but to have a central lab that the whole country can depend on is needed,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏTo have a staff dedicated to work on human remains and samples is needed. Because crime labs can‰Ûªt do this work alone ‰ÛÓ we couldn‰Ûªt have done this work alone. I don‰Ûªt know where their funding comes from, but they need to keep funding it, because this service is needed.‰Û<br><br>

The UNTCHI receives federal NIJ, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice funds, as well as money from the State of Texas for work on missing persons cases. It is one of only three centers dedicated to missing persons DNA analysis in the U.S., and the only academic institution with authorization to upload information into the national Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).

All states require medical students to pass a licensing exam before they receive licenses to practice medicine.

Scores from the first COMLEX are used by residency programs to select students for interviews and acceptance into medical specialty training programs. The M.D. equivalent is the United States Medical License Examination (USMLE).<br><br>

More than 600 students are enrolled at TCOM, a growth of 1,500 percent since the school‰Ûªs inception 37 years ago.åÊ TCOM graduates are in primary care and specialty practices across Texas and the nation.åÊ Along with traditional medical and surgical training, they bring to their patients the unique benefits of osteopathic diagnosis and treatment, and emphasize patient education, disease prevention, good nutrition and fitness.</p>

<p>We all watched the tragic events unfold at Virginia Polytechnic University this week with a sense of disbelief at the senseless violence and loss of lives.  I want to assure you that the UNT Health Science Center sent its condolences to both Virginia Tech and to the nearby Virginia College of Osteopathic Medicine.  We mourn with the students, faculty, staff and families who are enduring the pain and struggling to understand this unimaginable tragedy.</p>
<p>While no one wants to consider that such an act could be inflicted on our campus, we are a state institution with a campus that is open to the public.  It is possible that a disturbed individual could threaten our health or safety at any time.</p>
<p>Rest assured that our highly trained Campus Police patrol regularly and will respond to emergency situations quickly and professionally.  The Campus Police are in close contact with other law enforcement agencies that can offer additional support, if needed. </p> 
<p>Our <a href=""http://safety.hsc.unt.edu/office/epp/C9-EPP-all-s.pdf"">Emergency Preparedness Plan </a>is currently being updated.  It is important that you familiarize yourself with this plan, and remember these key actions in case of an emergency or terrorist act:</p>
<ul> <li> Evacuate the area if you can safely do so. </li>
<li>Call Campus Police at ext. 2600, or 817-735-2600 from a cell phone, to report suspicious activity or violence. DO NOT CALL 9-1-1.  </li>
<li>Move to an area where you can close and lock the door, if necessary. </li>
<li>There are more than 20 emergency telephones located across the campus. Emergency phones are located in all elevators, as well as most parking lots and garages. Once the talk button has been pushed, or the handset has been picked up, the caller can speak directly with a police dispatcher. </li>
<li>State law prohibits the possession of firearms in any building on the campus. This prohibition includes those persons normally licensed to carry a concealed weapon. Violations of state law or university policy will result in immediate action; including arrest and prosecution, referral to Student Affairs, and or disciplinary action for faculty and staff. Possession of explosives is prohibited anywhere on campus. 
</li>
<li>Rapid and reliable communication is critical to managing crises. In case of emergency, a campus-wide e-mail message may be sent to all users; the fire alarm intercom system may be used; and patrol officers may use the public address system on their vehicles. We also will establish a command center to handle campus communications, as well as the flow of information to the public. </li> </ul>

åÊ

Major technology advances have occurred in the life sciences over the past 10 years, and one of the fastest growing areas is fluorescence-based detection and fluorescence imaging. These are major areas of interest for commercial enterprises in developing new technology for use in optical sensing, enhanced security systems, biomedical diagnostics and tissue imaging. Advanced fluorescence and nanotechnologies, also known as nanophotonics, are the most recent tools developed by the Gryczynskis, Dr. Matveeva and Dr. Borejdo.<br><br>

åÊ

They bring to the Center the most advanced approaches in utilizing and advancing fluorescence technology into a center that will provide service and collaborations with industry and academia for our state, country and world partners. Texas, and indeed the whole Southwest, has no such center at present.<br><br>

The Center will enable biotechnology and nanotechnology clusters in Texas as well as provide training to enhance ongoing efforts and provide workforce educational programs in fluorescence nanophotonics technology. This will help in establishing and recruiting new industrial partners that will increase the economic potential within the state while increasing the Texas workforce.<br><br>

‰ÛÏTechnological innovation is the lifeblood of today‰Ûªs economy. Through this grant, we are elevating our state‰Ûªs emerging technology sector and universities to make Texas a strong competitor in the global marketplace,‰Û Gov.

         CorInnova, Inc. has leased a lab and office at the Center for BioHealth on the UNT Health Science Center campus, and has signed a client services agreement with TECH Fort Worth, a nonprofit incubator for technology startups. TECH Fort Worth will provide business mentoring, consulting and assistance in obtaining funding to help CorInnova bring their technology to market  In addition to space, the Health Science Center will provide other services, such as access to research databases, contract and grant management advice, and other services normally available only to university researchers.<br><br>

 

          ‰ÛÏThis agreement, and it is just the first of many, cements an idea that is core to the mission of TECH Fort Worth,‰Û said Darlene Ryan, executive director of TECH Fort Worth. ‰ÛÏOur pursuit of technology jobs and the Health Science Center‰Ûªs incredible resources are a magnet for life science startups in need of mentoring, business assistance and collaboration with university research capabilities.‰Û<br><br>

 

         ‰ÛÏWhen you put people in proximity to others with similar pursuits, the ideas seem to multiply. They find ways to work together.‰Û <br><br>

‰ÛÏIn addition to leased lab and office space, CorInnova will have access to other support services available to TECH Fort Worth client companies, including our Center for Research Management and detailed market research reports,‰Û said Dr. Robert D. McClain, associate vice president, Technology Transfer & Commercialization at UNT Health Science Center. ‰ÛÏWe think this gives CorInnova the environment it needs to expand its research.‰Û <br><br>



‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre thrilled to  have the opportunity to explore additional research opportunities with the Health Science Center and to work with TECH Fort Worth,‰Û said Dr. John Criscione, CEO and co-founder of CorInnova. Criscione is an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Texas A&M University.<br><br>

         CorInnova Incorporated, founded in July 2004, is an early stage medical device company that is developing and commercializing heart assist technologies that lead to heart recovery rather than heart replacement.   Funding for CorInnova has come through Texas A&M sponsored research, a grant from the National Institutes of Health STTR Fast-Track Award, and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund.<br><br>

The company‰Ûªs core technology is a device that enhances heart recovery through restoration of proper cardiac motion. This is a Texas A&M University technology invented by Dr. John Criscione. Recent discoveries indicate that heart maintenance, growth, and repair processes are guided by the mechanical stimuli that are restored by the device. CorInnova's approach is, in essence, physical therapy for the heart. For example, the maintenance, growth, and repair processes of the elbow are guided by joint motion, and thus physical therapy or restoration of joint motion enhances elbow recovery. <br><br>

If successful, CorInnova‰Ûªs first device would treat heart patients with aberrant cardiac motions, of which there are more than 70,000 annually in the United States. Clinical human trials could begin in 2008. <br><br>

There were more than 500 entries for this year&rsquo;s competition. The health science center group was named the top innovator in the student information systems category for its program &ldquo;No Medical Student Left Behind.&rdquo;<br /><br />             The No Medical Student Left Behind program was designed by Jerry Alexander, PhD, director of Academic Information Services. The program is a pro-active counseling approach, allowing faculty members and administrators in the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine to monitor the students&rsquo; progress throughout their medical school training.<br /><br />             &ldquo;When a student is assisted through a proactive approach and is able to successfully graduate, the large investment of the student, as well as the state of Texas, is protected,&rdquo; Dr. Alexander said.<br /><br />             The No Medical Student Left Behind program was initiated when Dr. Alexander learned from administrators at TCOM that they wanted a better way to track student performance so that they could intervene to help students before it was too late. Academic Information Services designed a program that would provide comprehensive tracking of students, focusing on reports that are available on each student in a real-time, electronic format. As soon as student exams are graded, the information is available online and integrated into the complete academic record.<br /><br />              Data are also available from pre-admission through the most recent test grade so that administrators can review trends and offer help to students who are in need of career advice or academic assistance.<br /><br />             To make the program as user-friendly as possible, Dr. Alexander added color-coding to reflect deviations from the class mean. Green is the optimal color; yellow is a warning, and red is when a student is in trouble.<br /><br />             &ldquo;Our goal was to make sure that this tool would be used, which is why we have made it so user friendly,&rdquo; Dr. Alexander said. &ldquo;We want the program to be intuitive, so that faculty members will use it to track student progress.&rdquo;<br /><br />             The program has been in existence for less than a year, but administrators and faculty members at the medical school have begun using it to make sure that all TCOM medical students are making progress.<br /><br />             &ldquo;I use it every day,&rdquo; said Bruce Dubin, DO, JD, associate dean for medical education and academic affairs at the TCOM. &ldquo;The program allows me very rapid access to information about students for career counseling and tracking their student success or failure. This pro-active approach allows for rapid interventions for potential student problems. It really is quite an accomplishment.&rdquo;<br /><br />             An unanticipated result of the No Medical Student Left Behind initiative was the effect it has had on students.<br /><br /> &ldquo;We were surprised at the level of support and enthusiasm for the project among students,&rdquo; Dr. Alexander said. &ldquo;As administrators began using the reports for advising and counseling, news of the project spread among students, and they began to come in and request counseling sessions.&rdquo;<br /><br />              As the program continues, Dr. Alexander has plans to expand the information available to administrators in the full counseling reports.<br /><br />              &ldquo;We plan to expand the project&rsquo;s scope to include more &lsquo;soft&rsquo; qualitative information about students, such as their extracurricular activities, interests and career goals,&rdquo; Dr. Alexander said.<br /><br />             Dr. Alexander presented information about the No Medical Student Left Behind program at the annual meeting of the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, and he will be presenting information about the program at other professional meetings.<br /><br /> ###<br /><br /> <strong>Contact:</strong> Kay Colley 817-735-2553, cell 817-980-5090, e-mail <a href=""mailto:kacolley@hsc.unt.edu"">kacolley@hsc.unt.edu</a>.",,,,,590,9/14/06 0:00,Kalish Named Executive Director to the President at UNT Health Science Center,"M.

One by one the slides tell the tale of what happened after one of the nation‰Ûªs greatest disasters as she describes her part in resolving the tragedy for hundreds of people.<br><br>

 

Her eyes grow red and tear as she talks about the victim‰Ûªs families.<br><br>

 

Then she quietly admits she gets emotional when she thinks about those days.<br><br>

 

Roby and a team of scientists were put into place to analyze thousands of samples of DNA from victims of the World Trade Center attack.<br><br>

 

For years they worked tirelessly to help families get back what terrorists took away ‰ÛÓ their loved ones.<br><br>

 

Roby said she still clearly remembers where she was when she heard the news the WTC had been attacked.<br><br>

 

‰ÛÏI was in bed in California, and my mother called me because my brother lives in New York City,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏI had conferencing capabilities at my home, so we were able to conference in and talk to my brother.<br><br>

 

‰ÛÏIn fact, we were on the phone with him when he saw the second plane go into the building.‰Û<br><br>

 

Later that day, Roby received another call about the WTC tragedy.<br><br>

 

‰ÛÏThat day, I got a phone call and was told, ‰Û÷We anticipate half a million to a million specimens,‰Ûª‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏThey didn‰Ûªt know how many people had survived. With what they were able to see, with the sheer impact, they knew it would be lots and lots of people.‰Û<br><br>

 

Roby said over time, the number of specimens to be tested decreased as the numbers of survivors and victims became more clear, but she and the other scientists who worked together had to move quickly to establish protocols that were not only legal, but would also ensure the highest amount of accuracy in the shortest amount of time.<br><br>

 

‰ÛÏWe knew the data analysis would be incredible and was something we weren‰Ûªt prepared for,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏWe didn‰Ûªt know how we would handle that.‰Û<br><br>

 

Roby said multiple teams of forensic scientists cooperated to establish a system that would accurately analyze the 21,000 specimens they received from the WTC attack.<br><br>

 

The emotion she feels comes not for the victims she helped identify, but for their families, she said.<br><br>

 

‰ÛÏI had some families tell me, ‰Û÷I don‰Ûªt need you to tell me my family member is dead,‰Ûª‰Û she said, ‰ÛÏbut I had other family members wrap their arms around me and thank me when I met them.‰Û<br><br>

 

Roby admits she has a passion for her work, but she is quick to deflect credit for her accomplishments from herself to each of the teams she has worked with on major projects, from the World Trade Center to identifying the remains of soldiers killed in the Vietnam War, the Korean War and World War II.<br><br>

 

She was also part of the team who helped identify the Branch Davidians killed in Waco in 1993 and helped identify Tsar Nicholas II and the Romanov family. She is currently a team member in the identification of Christopher Columbus. Roby was also the chief DNA analyst for the identification of the victims from the April 3, 1996, airline disaster carrying Secretary Ron Brown and colleagues.<br><br>

 

‰ÛÏEverything I have done has been as part of a team,‰Û Roby said. ‰ÛÏSo, I feel like I have been a part of innovations [in the field of DNA analysis], but I don‰Ûªt want you to feel I‰Ûªve done any one of those things singlehandedly.<br><br>

 

‰ÛÏThat 85 percent of the forensic labs are using technology I helped develop makes me sleep easy at night, because I feel like part of those cases are solved because I helped develop that technology. But it‰Ûªs not like if Rhonda Roby had never existed, it wouldn‰Ûªt have happened. Someone would have developed it, but I was a part of it.‰Û<br><br>

 

Now Roby is at the health science center working with Arthur Eisenberg, PhD, director of the DNA identity laboratory, to set up the tools she used in her work at the World Trade Center.<br><br>

 

‰ÛÏArt has a vision, and I believe in his vision, of a national missing persons database ‰ÛÓ a national database of DNA from the Americans that have someone missing from their family,‰Û Roby said. ‰ÛÏWhat we want to do is drop in the technology into the lab here like we did for the World Trade Center so they can process the samples in a higher throughput fashion.‰Û<br><br>

 

Roby said she looks forward to helping the DNA lab become more efficient without losing accuracy, and she said the robotics and chemistry used to extract DNA from samples from victims and their families would speed the time in which comparisons ‰ÛÓ and potential matches ‰ÛÓ could be made without sacrificing any accuracy.<br><br>

 

‰ÛÏWe have thousands of missing persons around the country and possibly hundreds of skeletal remains in a single medical examiner‰Ûªs office that nobody can link to anybody,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏSo if we can sweep the dust off an old box of skeletal remains that‰Ûªs been sitting in a medical examiner‰Ûªs office for 20 years, and if this lab can test those remains and create a DNA profile, and if this program can get the visibility it needs for families to submit their DNA for comparison to these old skeletal remains, multiple identifications can be made.‰Û<br><br>

 

Roby spent the fifth anniversary of 9/11 abroad ‰ÛÓ first in Chile as she works to help correctly identify victims of the Pinochet Regime, then to Spain to continue work on her doctorate. She will return to the health science center in October. <br><br>

            The program, Boardography, began recently when Program Director Kimberly Mills, PhD, approached the Office of Professional and Continuing Education at UNT Health Science Center and the Department of Public Affairs and Community Service at UNT Denton to give her program a home.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏI helped start a program similar to this at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Penn.,‰Û Dr. Mills said. ‰ÛÏIt was wildly successful. When my husband and I relocated back here for his work, I saw that DFW didn‰Ûªt have anything like this, so I started knocking on doors. The response has been tremendous.‰Û<br><br> 
            Boardography is designed to match professionals throughout the metroplex with nonprofit organizations who need volunteers to serve on their governing boards.<br><br> 
            ‰ÛÏOur community is filled with nonprofits,‰Û Dr. Mills said. ‰ÛÏThey all have boards, and they all need board members. At the same time, there are lots of professionals who really want a chance to develop personally and professionally through leadership experiences.‰Û<br><br>
            Dr. Mills facilitates the process by meeting personally with people who sign up for Boardography to determine a candidate‰Ûªs interests and skills. She also meets with nonprofit organizations throughout the metroplex to determine what their specific needs are for board members. After finding candidates and nonprofits that match, she sends the nonprofit organizations information about the candidates.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏAt that point, it‰Ûªs up to the candidates and the nonprofits to make a mutual decision to see if the nonprofit wants to invite the candidate to join the board and the candidate wants to accept,‰Û Dr. Mills said. ‰ÛÏSo I don‰Ûªt actually make matches. I make introductions.‰Û<br><br>
            The new program is free to both nonprofit organizations and candidates, so it exists based on donations from individuals and groups. RadioShack is the founding funder.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏEveryone in the community benefits from this program,‰Û Dr. Mills said. ‰ÛÏNonprofits get stronger board members; people in need get stronger nonprofit organizations; professionals get to join boards that they are interested in, and corporations get employees who are more engaged in the community.‰Û<br><br>

            The STAR, stands for Steps Toward Academic Research, fellowship program was developed by researchers at the health science center to help address health disparities.<br><br> 
            ‰ÛÏThere is a great need to address issues of health disparities,‰Û said Jamboor K. Vishwanatha, PhD, program director for Texas EXPORT Center and associate dean and professor in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at the health science center. ‰ÛÏWe are just beginning in our efforts to provide much needed research opportunities on health disparities by providing faculty members an opportunity to help understand and eliminate health disparities among minority populations.‰Û<br><br>
            The fellowship, designed for emerging biomedical scientists at minority-serving institutions to learn how to study health disparities, is a mentorship program. Fellows are provided with collaborative training with faculty members from the health science center and other institutions directed toward fostering health disparities research initiatives. <br><br>
Ten faculty members from around the country were chosen for the inaugural class. Fellows are allowed to keep their current faculty appointments while participating in the year-long fellowship.<br><br>
            Throughout the year, fellows will participate in a variety of educational programs provided by STAR fellowship program faculty in a variety of modes. The fellows began their training with a three-day orientation at the first annual Health Disparities Conference hosted by the health science center June 2-4. Monthly, weekend online or onsite seminars will take place throughout the rest of the year.<br><br> 
            Fellows will learn about the epidemiology and biostatistics of health disparity, research design, computer technology, community assessment, human subjects research, compliance with Institutional Review Boards, scientific communications, grant writing, health policy and survey research, and they will participate in a simulated research grant review process.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThe goal of this fellowship is to increase the number of investigators from the underrepresented minorities involved in health disparity research,‰Û Dr. Vishwanatha said.  ‰ÛÏThis is an integral part of our Texas EXPORT Center because it extends our valuable existing partnerships with minority-serving institutions in Texas and surrounding states and provides valuable opportunities to develop collaborative research programs addressing health disparities.‰Û<br><br>
            The National Institutes of Health awarded the health center a $7.25 million grant in 2005 to establish the Texas Center for Health Disparities, called the Texas EXPORT Center. <br><br>          
The grant, known as Project EXPORT‰ÛÓEstablishing Exploratory Centers, will be funded for five years, from 2005 to 2010, by NIH‰Ûªs National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities.<br><br> 
            STAR Fellowship Program mentors from the health science center include Dr. Vishwanatha,  associate dean of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences; Thomas Yorio, PhD, GSBS dean and vice president for research; Robert Kaman, PhD, JD, associate dean and director of the Office of Outreach for GSBS and associate professor of health management and policy; Bruce Dubin, DO, JD, associate dean of academic affairs and medical education for the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine; Adela Gonzalez, PhD, assistant professor of health management and policy and vice president for community affairs and institutional diversity; Michael Smith, PhD, chair and professor of integrative physiology; Roberto Cardarelli, DO, MPH, assistant professor of family medicine; and James Caffrey, PhD, professor of integrative physiology and acting director of the cardiovascular research division.<br><br>

The researchers found that non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be insured compared to non-Hispanic whites, mostly through public insurance, such as Medicaid and Medicare.<br /><br />  However, Hispanics were three times more likely to be uninsured compared to non-Hispanic blacks and were more likely to have a shorter length of stay than non-Hispanic whites. The researchers concluded that the differences in care were a result of aggressive case management, barriers to healthcare based on socio-cultural issues and possibly discriminatory practices. The researchers could not conclude whether the differences in care based on these factors were intentional or unintentional.<br /><br />             &ldquo;These findings are not news,&rdquo; Dr. Coustasse said. &ldquo;But the main thing is that Hispanic Medicaid patients were being discharged earlier than other patients. That is news and a reality of discriminatory and/or stereotyping practices.&rdquo;<br /><br />             The researchers also discovered that Hispanics were more likely to relapse. The researchers believe that the relapses occurred because Hispanics were discharged earlier, interrupting the normal course of care. This interruption of care hindered access to treatment such as rehab. At the time of the study, the waiting period for the only public rehabilitation facility in the county was 21 days.<br /><br />             The researchers conclude that this 21-day wait increased the instance of relapse among Hispanics, creating a vicious circle.<br /><br /> &ldquo;If you have to wait 21 days, forget it,&rdquo; Dr. Coustasse said.<br /><br /> The researchers received the award in March at the annual Midwest Business Administration Association Conference, which took place in Chicago.<br /><br /> ###<br /><br /> <strong>Contact: </strong>Kay Colley 817-735-2553, cell 817-980-5090, e-mail <a href=""mailto:kacolley@hsc.unt.edu"">kacolley@hsc.unt.edu</a>.",,,,,533,6/12/06 0:00,"Hispanic Wellness Fair Scheduled for Aug. 5, Bilingual Volunteers Needed","The eighth annual Hispanic Wellness Fair will take place Saturday, Aug. 5, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Amon Carter Exhibits Hall, Will Rogers Memorial Complex.<br>

            Davila, graduated with a master‰Ûªs of public health degree with a concentration in community health May 20, was an intern at the CDC last summer. She earned the internship and the fellowship through the Hispanic-Serving Health Professions Schools. Davila was in the inaugural class of HSHPS interns last summer and will be in the inaugural class of HSHPS fellows this year.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm excited because this will give me more experience, and I‰Ûªll have a mentor who can provide me with a little more guidance in terms of research,‰Û Davila said. ‰ÛÏI believe this will be a great stepping stone for my career.‰Û<br><br>
            During her six-month fellowship, Davila will work on the project ‰ÛÏNational Diabetes Education Program: Effectiveness of Outreach to Health Disparity Populations.‰Û Her previous studies have included work with <i>Salud Para Su Corazon</i> and the Diabetes Research Education and Metabolic Studies programs at the health science center. Her work focused on ways to enhance delivery of programs to Hispanic populations.<br><br>
‰ÛÏI‰Ûªd like to stay at CDC after this fellowship,‰Û Davila said. ‰ÛÏBut eventually, I‰Ûªd like to go back to the McAllen area because that‰Ûªs where the population is located that I want to help.‰Û<br><br>
            Davila is from McAllen, where she graduated from Nikki Rowe High School. When the 23-year-old began her college studies, she was a pre-med major at Southwestern University in Georgetown. She graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in biology with a pre-medical emphasis, but her interests turned to more community-based work when she looked into graduate education.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏGoing into medicine just wasn‰Ûªt as exciting as the idea of helping so many people through public health,‰Û Davila said.<br><br>
            Davila plans to focus her research and outreach work on the Hispanic population to help address healthcare inequities.<br><br>

And now she is. <br><br>
On Saturday, she walked across the stage at the Fort Worth Convention Center and received her doctorate in public health from UNT Health Science Center. But when she was a little girl, Sanchez thought she would be getting her doctorate in medicine.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏOriginally, I was planning on applying to medical school,‰Û Sanchez said, ‰ÛÏbut I graduated early, so I wanted to do something in the interim.‰Û<br><br>
            Sanchez earned her bachelor of science degree from Texas A&M University in three years, and on the advice of a professor at A&M, she enrolled in its School of Rural Public Health, where she earned her master‰Ûªs of public health degree.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏI got more and more into [public health], and it became my passion,‰Û Sanchez said. ‰ÛÏI was hooked. I felt really lucky that I had found something that I loved.‰Û<br><br>
            Sanchez, an Aledo High School graduate, came back to the Fort Worth area to complete her doctorate in public health after her stint at Texas A&M. Her dissertation topic drew on her knowledge of Fort Worth and the Hispanic community.<br><br>
‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm interested in looking into health disparities, particularly among the Hispanic population,‰Û Sanchez said. <br><br>
            Sanchez‰Ûªs research for her dissertation, ‰ÛÏFactors that Motivate Hispanics to Participate in Church-Based Health Interventions,‰Û took place at parishes in Fort Worth. She used focus group sessions conducted in Spanish to discover the social and behavioral factors that make Hispanics want to become involved in health interventions at their parish.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏI discovered that a lot of it depended on the familiarity that people had with the church,‰Û Sanchez said. ‰ÛÏThe church is seen as a gateway in the Hispanic community. Once the word is out and people begin participating, more individuals are likely to come. They think of the church as their second home.‰Û<br><br>
            Sanchez comes from a diverse background. Her father was born in Mexico, and her mother is of Native American and Hispanic descent. Her older sister practices law in Fort Worth and Weatherford. Sanchez is a graduate of Aledo High School, and currently lives in Aledo. <br><br>
            She said she hopes to continue her community work in health disparities.<br><br> 
            ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªd really like to stay around here if I can,‰Û Sanchez said. ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm interested in academia, and I‰Ûªd really like to continue with my community-based work. This is my passion.‰Û<br><br>

            UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs request for $42 million for a public health and education building was on the list of 63 projects across the state that were included with the passage of House Bill 153.<br><br> 
            The bill, originally approved by the House last week, allowed state colleges and universities to issue more than $3.5 billion in tuition revenue bonds. The Senate cut the amount to $1.8 billion worth of projects with its revision and approval on Sunday. The House approved the changed bill and sent it to the governor on Monday.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThis gives us the needed funding to continue the momentum of our growth in education, research and patient care,‰Û said Ronald Blanck, DO, president of UNT Health Science Center. ‰ÛÏAll of us at the health science center are grateful to our legislators for their recognition of our needs and our excellence.‰Û<br><br>
During the 2005 regular legislative session, tuition revenue bond requests stalled. Higher education officials had hoped to revisit the bond requests in the special session scheduled this March and gain funding for capital projects throughout the state.<br><br>
Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said passage of the bill during this special session has ‰ÛÏensured that the future of higher education in Texas is bright and that we can prepare our future leaders.‰Û<br><br>
            Tuition revenue bonds are issued by institutions of higher education. While authorized, bonds have not been funded. Funding will be discussed during the next regular session of the Legislature in January 2007.<br><br>
            The health science center requested the funding as part of its master planning process to integrate newly purchased land adjacent to its main campus.<br><br> 
The property, which had housed the Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas, was purchased in April 2005 by the health science center. A master planning process began shortly after the purchase of the property to help determine best usage.<br><br> 
State Senator Jane Nelson was instrumental in securing approval for the measure, especially for the health science center.<br>
‰ÛÏWe have a unique opportunity to allow a land-locked university to expand and support additional students,‰Û Sen. Nelson said in a press release May 15. ‰ÛÏThis project will also help patients across Texas who are going to benefit as this center graduates more highly-skilled health care providers.‰Û<br><br>
Sen. Nelson is chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services. She represents District 12, which includes the health science center campus. <br><br>

            With the grant funding, Dr. Licciardone will look more closely at OMT use for the treatment of chronic low back pain and other musculoskeletal disorders, refinement of placebo control treatments for pain and functioning, assessment of somatovisceral and viscerosomatic manifestations of disease, and description of the natural history and epidemiology of somatic dysfunction.<br><br> 
Dr. Licciardone also plans to expand his research into osteopathic health services and policy research, which will include the Osteopathic Survey of Health Care in America, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and a systematic review and meta-analysis of osteopathic clinical trials. This research is intended not only to study patient outcomes with osteopathic treatment, but to promote patient awareness of osteopathic physicians and encourage their use as primary care physicians.<br><br> 
Dr. Licciardone administered the previous Osteopathic Surveys of Health Care in America. He said that he hopes to further findings from the previous surveys.<br><br> 
            ‰ÛÏWith this research, we‰Ûªd like to have more focused questions and look more specifically at racial and ethnic minority groups,‰Û he said.<br><br>
            The previous survey found that only 9 percent of the population said that their primary care physician was a doctor of osteopathic medicine, with racial and ethnic minorities having the lowest percentage of respondents who used a DO as their primary care physician.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThe previous surveys gave us some valuable information, but we weren‰Ûªt always able to determine the reasons for the results we observed,‰Û Dr. Licciardone said. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre hoping to answer more of those questions with this research.‰Û<br><br>

            ‰ÛÏThe Osteopathic Heritage Foundation has been very generous,‰Û Dr. Licciardone said.<br><br> 
            The Osteopathic Heritage Foundation has provided three major grants to the ORC, in addition to financial support for start-up and operating costs of the ORC.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm confident that if we do good research we‰Ûªll continue to be funded,‰Û Dr. Licciardone said.<br><br>

Dr. Zinkernagel shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in medicine with Peter C. Doherty, PhD, for ‰ÛÏtheir discoveries concerning the specificity of the cell mediated immune defense,‰Û according to the Nobel Foundation. Dr. Zinkernagel was 29 when he discovered how the immune system recognizes viruses in cells. He has spent the bulk of his career researching viruses and the immune system at the University of Zurich in Switzerland.<br><br>
In addition to winning the Nobel Prize, Drs. Zinkernagel and Doherty won the Lasker Award in 1995. Both awards were for research that the duo had done between 1973 and 1975 in Canberra, Australia. During studies of how mice respond to viruses, they found that white blood cells must recognize both the virus and certain ‰ÛÏself‰Û molecules to kill the virus-infected cells. These ‰ÛÏself‰Û molecules are now recognized as key determinants to the success or failure of transplants. <br><br>
The discovery of how the immune system reacts to viruses led Dr. Zinkernagel to work on other viruses, including HIV, later in his research career.<br><br>

            The project is in conjunction with Xinu Zhang, PhD, research scientist at the health science center; Lee Alward, MD, from the University of Iowa; and Abe Clark, PhD, of Alcon Research, Ltd., are serving as a co-investigators on the project.<br><br> 
            The five-year grant titled ‰ÛÏGlucocorticoids, Ocular Hypertension and Glaucoma‰Û pairs lab research and patient care to discover why patients with glaucoma have increased intraocular pressure when treated with topical glucocorticoids. This increase in eye pressure can exacerbate glaucoma or create ocular damage if patients are treated for long periods of time with glucocorticoids.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThis would allow us to determine if what we suspect is true, that the increased responsiveness to the drugs may be due to differences in the amount of receptors that individuals have for the glucocorticoids,‰Û Dr. Yorio said.<br><br>
            Glaucoma is a group of diseases that leads to blindness by damaging the optic nerve. The optic nerve is responsible for carrying images from the eye to the brain, which is why damage to it leads to vision loss. Glaucoma is one of the leading cause of blindness, and currently, there is no cure for it, although it can be treated and its progression slowed by early detection. Experts from the Glaucoma Research Foundation estimate that half of the people affected by glaucoma may not know that they have the disease.<br><br>
What Dr. Yorio and the researchers in this project have hypothesized is that glaucoma patients are missing an interference receptor known as glucocorticoid receptor beta. Because the receptor is missing in the nucleus the response to administered glucocorticoids is enhanced in these patients. This could allow for a screening method to determine what patients would be likely to develop glaucoma.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏIf this were the case, we would be able to intervene with treatment before appreciable vision loss is detected,‰Û Dr. Yorio said.<br><br>
            Dr. Yorio‰Ûªs lab at the health science center will look at the molecular biology and cellular mechanisms associated with glucocorticoid administration, trying to determine if differences exist in the receptors of glaucoma patients. Dr. Clark will work with Dr. Yorio to examine tissues and cells for mechanisms that could account for the differences in glucocorticoid responsiveness between normal patients and patients with glaucoma. Dr. Alward will examine patients with glaucoma and without glaucoma to determine genetic differences in the pathways that have been identified by Dr. Yorio‰Ûªs lab.<br><br> 
            This project grew out of the research of Dr. Zhang, when she was a graduate student in Dr. Yorio‰Ûªs laboratory. Dr. Zhang‰Ûªs initial studies were recently published in the journal <i>Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science</i>. A figure from one of her publications appears on the cover of the February issue of the journal.<br><br> 
            ‰ÛÏDr. Zhang‰Ûªs research has led to a most interesting observation that could result in making a profound discovery on the relationship between glucocorticoid receptors and glaucoma,‰Û Dr. Yorio said.<br><br> 
‰ÛÏI‰Ûªve been studying eye diseases for more than 30 years, with specific emphasis on glaucoma. This study is just part of an overall program in our laboratory to understand the fundamental cellular mechanisms that lead to the development of glaucoma and to identify potential new treatments. Our laboratory has several patents and applications pending on new discoveries for the treatment of this ocular neurodegenerative disease.‰Û<br><br>

Gatson, doctoral candidate in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, was recently awarded a Grass Fellowship at the Marine Biological Laboratory.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏI applied first of all just to get more exposure in how research is conducted in academia,‰Û Gatson said. ‰ÛÏIn the Grass Fellowship, you actually go in as an independent investigator. I wouldn‰Ûªt go into the program as a PhD student or a postdoctoral student, but more as a new faculty member. All of my work will be independent.‰Û<br><br>
As part of his application, Gatson wrote a grant proposal for the Grass Foundation to outline his course of research during the fellowship period.<br><br> 
In his proposal, Gatson hypothesized that the androgen receptor forms a complex with the estrogen receptor and blocks the survival-promoting effects of estrogen. Research has shown that estrogen protects the brain against injury. According to Gatson, if more of the androgen receptor binds to the estrogen receptor, the androgen receptor blocks the neuroprotective effects of estrogen, which would mean that estrogen treatment may not help people with high levels of androgen or high 
androgen receptor levels. His research this summer will work on this hypothesis.<br><br>
‰ÛÏThere are very few studies that look at the effects of androgens in various disease states in the brain,‰Û Gatson said. ‰ÛÏSince very little attention has been focused on androgens in the brain, that can be a positive as well as a negative. The good thing about pursuing this area of research is that I can open the door and describe the importance of androgens during various disease states. The negative side to studying androgens in the brain is that very little information has been published on androgen action in the brain, so I have to try to figure out the ins and outs. This research that I do this summer should shed some light on the role of the androgen receptor as well as testosterone with respect to neuroprotection.‰Û<br><br>
Gatson will begin his Grass Fellowship on May 21 and remain at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., until Aug. 26.<br><br>  
            Gatson earned his master‰Ûªs degree at the health science center in microbiology and immunology in Spring 2003. He has been active in campus events and has served as Black Graduate Student Association president for two years and vice president for two years. He has also been active in the Graduate Student Association, and he has worked with Fort Worth ISD high school students as a Schools‰Ûª Cooperative Opportunities for Resources and Education (SCORE) fellow for three years.<br><br> 
Gatson works under the supervision of Meharvan Singh, PhD, assistant professor in pharmacology and neuroscience.<br><br>

That‰Ûªs what researchers at UNT Health Science Center discovered.<br><br>
In an article published in the open access journal <i>BMC Family Practice</i>, Roberto Cardarelli, DO, MPH, FAAFP, assistant professor of family medicine, and John C. Licciardone, DO, MS, MBA, professor and director of clinical research for the Osteopathic Research Center at the health science center, report their findings.<br><br>
Drs. Cardarelli,  Licciardone and Lockwood G. Taylor discuss the results of their study of 20 brochures from 20 different drug companies in the article, ‰ÛÏA cross-sectional evidence-based review of pharmaceutical promotional marketing brochures and their underlying studies: Is what they tell us important and true?‰Û<br><br>
 The researchers found that three out of 20 promotional brochures studied contained data that was different from the original study on the effects of the drug. Although the differences were small, the authors of the study recommend that doctors review original studies instead of changing their drug 
prescribing behavior based on promotional brochures.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏFurther research is needed in this area,‰Û Dr. Cardarelli said. ‰ÛÏThe next step is to better understand and determine if pharmaceutical promotional products change a physician‰Ûªs prescribing habits. More importantly, if it does, we must ensure that the information is accurate.‰Û<br><br>
Dr. Cardarelli and his colleagues asked physicians in five clinics to collect the promotional brochures that they had received from pharmaceutical companies. Twenty brochures representing 20 different drugs were collected from October to December 2004, and the original corresponding studies were obtained. Two reviewers compared the content of each brochure with the data presented in the original study. <br><br>
‰ÛÏThe research and service that pharmaceutical companies provide is imperative in the development of new medications that treat and cure disease,‰Û Dr. Cardarelli said. ‰ÛÏAs we found, the quality of most studies was excellent. Nonetheless, we must be aware that ethical obligations and business are two different things. We must ensure that one does not influence the other.‰Û<br><br>
The study results show that for three of the brochures studied, the data presented on the brochure differed from the results of the underlying study. Of the 20 identified studies, 15 studies were rated as valid and 16 had been funded by the pharmaceutical company producing the drug. <br><br>
The article can be found in <i>BMC Family Practice‰Ûªs </i>latest edition at http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcfampract/ BioMed Central (http://www.biomedcentral.com) is an independent online publishing house committed to providing open access to peer-reviewed biological and medical research.

The instrument‰Ûªs arrival was also timed to coincide with the arrival of new Robert A. Welch Professor Laszlo Prokai, PhD, who is in charge of it. Dr. Prokai uses mass spectrometry in his research, which focuses on the areas of aging, neurodegenerative diseases and biodefense.<br><br> 
Mass spectrometry is used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify compounds, and to discover the structure and chemical properties of molecules. The use of mass spectrometry has been around for quite some time, with the beginnings of its use starting in 1899, but recently the technique has become integral in the field of proteomics.<br><br>
Proteomics is the large-scale study of the proteins that are produced by genes.<br><br> 
‰ÛÏProteomics is the next step in understanding diseases, for one, but because the field is so new, we are discovering a myriad of applications,‰Û Dr. Prokai said. ‰ÛÏMass spectrometry is an essential tool 
for use in the field.‰Û<br><br>
The new instrument is the most powerful mass spectrometer in the Metroplex. The magnetic field within the instrument is one million times stronger than the earth‰Ûªs own magnetic field, Dr. Prokai said.<br><br>
‰ÛÏWhen I saw the specifications for this instrument, I was just blown away,‰Û Dr. Prokai said. ‰ÛÏThis mass spectrometer‰Ûªs capabilities will support biomedical research and drug discovery in and outside of UNT Health Science Center. We are very excited to have it available here.‰Û<br><br>
 To accommodate the $1 million instrument, certain alterations had to be made to the laboratory where it is housed. The sheer weight of the instrument was too much for the building, so personnel in the facilities department at the health science center installed a metal plate on the floor in the laboratory to diffuse the weight across the entire floor.<br><br>
Another challenge was the constant temperature that has to be maintained to keep the mass spectrometer functioning properly. An additional air conditioning system had to be installed to allow for this requirement.<br><br>
Finally, the instrument itself requires large amounts of liquid nitrogen and liquid helium upon start-up and constant maintenance levels of these two cryogenic liquids. <br><br>
 Personnel associated with the new proteomics facility had to be trained on the maintenance and use of the new mass spectrometer for almost a month, even though Dr. Prokai has been using mass spectrometry as an analytical tool for most of his career and many of his lab members have been using mass spectrometry for many years as well.<br><br>
‰ÛÏTo a trained mass spectrometrist, this instrument is going to be very user friendly,‰Û Dr. Prokai said. ‰ÛÏWe are confident that we will be able to operate the instrument so that we will be able to utilize all of its wonderful capabilities.‰Û<br><br>
Mass spectrometry is currently used in a variety of ways, including to identify the use of steroids in athletes, monitor the breath of patients by anesthesiologists during surgery, determine the composition of molecular species found in space, determine whether honey is adulterated with corn syrup, locate oil deposits by measuring petroleum precursors in rock, monitor the fermentation processes for the biotechnology industry, detect dioxins in contaminated fish, determine gene damage from environmental causes, and establish the elemental composition of semiconductor materials. As the field of proteomics continues to grow, the uses for mass spectrometry will also expand, Dr. Prokai said.<br><br>
The mass spectrometer at the health science center is currently being leased, with the hope that grant monies will be obtained to eventually buy the instrument.<br><br>

            ‰ÛÏAlthough our funding was down a bit from the previous year, we do have some big projects that will push us even further for this year,‰Û said Glenn Dillon, PhD, associate vice president for research and biotechnology at the health science center. ‰ÛÏWe still think we‰Ûªre in pretty good shape.‰Û<br><br>
            For fiscal year 2005, the health science center had almost $20,010,000 in research funding, while the fiscal year 2004 numbers were at a little more than $22 million.
            Still some areas posted gains for fiscal year 2005. The Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine as a whole went from more than $5 million in research funding for fiscal year 2004 to $6.5 million in fiscal year 2005.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏOur drive to improve our research funding has led to this significant increase,‰Û said Marc B.

            The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences experienced a slight drop in funding this past year, due to decreases in individual research grant funding at the National Institutes of Health, according to Thomas Yorio, PhD, vice president for research. Despite the tight NIH budget, the Department of Molecular Biology and Immunology saw a slight increase from about $2.9 million in fiscal year 2004 to just over $3 million in research funding in fiscal year 2005. The Department of Outreach also saw an increase from $285,000 in fiscal year 2004 to $490,000 in fiscal year 2005, with total GSBS research funding exceeding $12.6 million in fiscal year 2005.<br><br>
            The Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience again posted the highest total of research funding dollars for an individual department with a little over $6 million in funding for fiscal year 2005.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThis has been a difficult year for extramural research funding at all institutions,‰Û Dr. Yorio said. ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm pleased with how our institution fared in the past fiscal year.

            The project funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism will specifically look at binge drinking, the act of consuming large amounts of alcohol within a short period of time.<br><br>
            The practice of binge drinking, which is predominantly associated with adolescents and young adults, is also practiced by about 20 percent of the American population aged 12 and older, according to a 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. According to the NIAAA, 1,400 college students die every year from alcohol-related causes, and more than 150,000 students develop a health problem related to alcohol consumption. One of the health problems that can be related to binge drinking is brain damage.<br><br> 
            According to Dr. de Fiebre, patients who end up in the emergency room as a result of binge 
drinking receive mostly supportive therapy at that point ‰ÛÓ respirators to keep the patient alive. Currently, no therapies are available to alleviate the brain damaging properties of an alcohol overdose. The researchers hope that results from this grant will fill this void.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏWhat we want to find out is the threshold where you‰Ûªre going to start killing brain cells,‰Û Dr. de Fiebre said. ‰ÛÏWhen we find that threshold, we‰Ûªll be able to look at potential therapeutic treatments to keep the brain cells alive.‰Û<br><br>
            The $362,688 grant will fund a two-year research project. The first year will be spent developing a mouse model of binge-drinking-induced neurotoxicity to define the minimum amount of alcohol that produces brain damage. The second year will be spent working with mice that are missing the alpha7 nicotinic receptor to determine if and how this receptor decreases the brain damaging effects of alcohol.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏAlcohol acts at dozens if not hundreds of different receptor sites,‰Û Dr. de Fiebre said. ‰ÛÏOur preliminary data suggest that the presence or absence of the receptors that nicotine acts at, the alpha7 receptor, may determine if you end up with a hangover, in the hospital or dead after a night of binge drinking.‰Û<br><br>
            The next two years of work funded by the NIAA will help corraborate the de Fiebres‰Ûª previous work. And if Dr. de Fiebre‰Ûªs hypothesis proves to be true, the results could be used in studies of other types of brain-damaging diseases such as Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease.<br><br>

            The group of 20 was chosen to create a network of Chileans outside of Chile who can create a network in North America called Chile Global. Members of Chile Global, which has now expanded to 60 members, will work to establish relationships and facilitate projects to address the ‰ÛÏbrain drain‰Û occurring in this South American country. A brain drain is when top researchers and scientists from a developing country leave that country for more lucrative work in developed countries. When that brain drain occurs, the developing country loses people who can help in the development process.<br><br>
            The World Bank has worked on a project called ‰ÛÏMobilization of Diasporas for Knowledge Transfer‰Û in India, China and Israel to transform their brain drains into brain circulation. To that end, the 
Chilean government became involved with the World Bank in the project to help direct investment into the economy of Chile, with the goal of becoming a developed country by 2015. <br><br>
Currently, Chile is reinvesting a percentage of its gross domestic product to research and development for technology transfer. According to Dr. Coustasse, the government would like to expand this area and focus on improving several aspects of the Chilean economy, which is where Dr. Coustasse comes in.<br><br>
            As part of Chile Global, Dr. Coustasse is working to find people, businesses or government entities who want to compete for federal projects from the government of Chile. The project areas of interest include biotechnology, health information systems, nutrition, environmental health, virology, biochemistry, agricultural products and aquaculture, just to name a few. The Chilean government will provide $6.6 million for grant projects in the next year. If the congress of Chile approves a royalty bill for the mining industry, the grant funding amount could expand to $140 million for technological innovation.<br><br>
            Knowledge of Spanish is not necessary to apply for a grant project or to work on a joint venture with different Chilean agencies. Dr. Coustasse will serve as a liaison between project applicants, Fundacion Chile and the Chilean government.<br><br> 
            ‰ÛÏThis is an exciting opportunity, and I‰Ûªm looking forward to helping make the connection between researchers and officials in Chile,‰Û Dr. Coustasse said.<br><br>

Welch Professor. He will establish the new proteomics laboratories, as well as a state-of-the-art mass spectrometer, the largest in North Texas.<br><br>
            The Welch Professor position was funded by the Welch Foundation, one of the oldest and largest private funding sources for basic chemical research in the United States.<br><br> 
            Dr. Prokai plans to focus his proteomics research, with the help of the new mass spectrometer, on the research areas of aging, neurodegenerative diseases and biodefense. His interests also lie in the discovery of new drugs to combat these diseases.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs no longer enough to have research for the sake of research alone,‰Û Dr. Prokai said. ‰ÛÏIt has to have an end of helping people. We believe that the compounds we are working on are useful in combating multiple diseases.‰Û<br><br>
            Dr. Prokai‰Ûªs background in a variety of subjects makes him somewhat unique in the world of 
science. His bachelor‰Ûªs degree is in chemical engineering, his master‰Ûªs degree is in radiochemical
technology, and his doctorate is in radiochemistry, but his research has brought him into medicinal
chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceutics, drug discovery, neuroscience and, finally, into the department of molecular biology at the health science center. <br><br>
            ‰ÛÏI aspire to be a renaissance man,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏWhen something catches my interest, I strive to learn more and more about it‰ÛÓeven outside my field of training and expertise. When you confine yourself to one piece of the puzzle, you‰Ûªre not able to put together the whole picture.‰Û<br><br>
            Dr. Prokai and his wife Katalin Prokai, PhD, work together as primary research partners, and she will work in the Prokai labs as a research associate professor in pharmacology and neuroscience. Her background is also in chemistry, with a specific interest in drug discovery.<br><br>
            The Prokais‰Ûª arrival was also timed to include the arrival of the new mass spectrometer that will be located in the Prokai labs‰ÛÓin addition to two instruments that were moved to the health science center from the University of Florida. The new mass spectrometer is the most powerful mass spectrometer in the Metroplex. The magnetic field within the instrument is one million times stronger than the earth‰Ûªs own magnetic field, Dr. Prokai said.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏWhen I saw the specifications for this machine, I was just blown away,‰Û Dr. Prokai said. ‰ÛÏThis mass spectrometer‰Ûªs capabilities will support drug discovery in and outside of UNT Health Science Center. We are very excited to have it available here.‰Û<br><br>
            In the mean time, the Prokais are setting up their labs and offices to continue the work that they enjoy most and plan for doing research together with other health science center faculty members.<br><br>

            ‰ÛÏThis grant will allow us to explore our strengths in terms of research, education and outreach,‰Û said Jamboor Vishwanatha, PhD, program director for the grant and associate dean and professor in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. ‰ÛÏWe will be able to try out our ideas and find our strengths in the effort to address issues of health disparities and help eliminate them.‰Û<br><br>
            The grant submitted by the health science center was one of 218 proposals from across the country, and NIH funded only six.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThis is truly exciting,‰Û said Ronald Blanck, DO, president of the health science center. ‰ÛÏBecause NIH recognized the quality of the programs that we already have that are designed to address health disparities, we were able to forgo years of work and automatically become an exploratory center. This puts us well along the path of becoming a comprehensive center, the final step in this three-step process.‰Û<br><br>
The grant, known as Project EXPORT‰ÛÓEstablishing Exploratory Centers, will be funded for five years, from 2005 to 2010, by NIH‰Ûªs National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities. <br><br>
At the end of the five years, Dr. Vishwanatha said he hopes to apply for a comprehensive center grant, further establishing the health science center as a leader in addressing minority healthcare issues.<br><br>
The objectives of the center are to foster existing relationships and develop new relationships with underrepresented minority institutions. This will be done by providing opportunities for minority students and faculty to perform health disparity research, Dr. Vishwanatha said.<br><br>
The grant will also promote educating students, healthcare practitioners and policy makers on the existence of health disparities and the need to combat the problem, he said. The EXPORT Center will also serve as a resource for minority communities in North Texas by disseminating health information, promoting community participation in health education and research, and implementing disease prevention activities.<br><br> 
Dr. Vishwanatha said the center will focus on research in areas where health disparities exist for minorities in North Texas, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, stroke and HIV.<br><br> 
            The center will have four administrative cores headed by investigators at the health science center. Dr. Vishwanatha will lead the administrative core that oversees the entire grant.<br><br> 
            A call for applications for pilot projects to be funded through the EXPORT Center is scheduled to go out in early November. The first round of funded projects will likely begin immediately thereafter, Dr. Vishwanatha said.<br><br>
            A conference that will address health disparities among minorities is tentatively scheduled for the summer of 2006, and the first group of researchers from underrepresented minority institutions will 
begin training in the spring of 2006, along with the first group of minority students.<br><br>
            Dr. Vishwanatha said he hopes that the EXPORT Center will provide much needed research opportunities on health disparities and an opportunity to recruit minority health professionals to understand and eliminate health disparities among minority populations.<br><br>
            Since the combined minority populations of Texas surpassed the non-Hispanic white population in 2004, the issue of health disparities among minority populations will continue to be an issue. By the year 2026, the Hispanic population is projected to become the majority population in Texas.<br><br> 
            ‰ÛÏHere at UNT Health Science Center, we‰Ûªve worked throughout Tarrant County to help eliminate health disparities and recruit more underrepresented minority students into our student body,‰Û Dr. Blanck said. ‰ÛÏThis center will expand on the work that we‰Ûªve already been doing.‰Û<br><br>

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a painful, progressive condition that occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the hand, becomes pressed or squeezed at the wrist. Initial treatment for the disorder usually involves wearing a splint to keep the wrist from twisting or bending, and the condition may even lead to surgery if the symptoms persist for six months or longer.<br><br>
            The $568,000 grant, ‰ÛÏTreatment Efficacy of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,‰Û will support a three-year clinical trial to examine whether an eight week regimen of osteopathic manipulative treatment will have immediate and lasting positive effects on the symptoms, functional limitation, and physiologic impairment associated with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.<br><br>    
The Osteopathic Research Center, a national research organization housed at the UNT Health Science Center, was developed in 2001 with an initial investment of $1.1 million over a four- year period (2002-2005) from the American Osteopathic Foundation, the American Osteopathic Association and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine. These same osteopathic organizations have re-funded the ORC for the next four years, bringing the total investment to $2 million for the eight year period.<br><br>
The ORC works to increase evidence-based knowledge about the mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy of osteopathic manipulative medicine through research, training, and conducting local and national research. <br><br>

This strategy of investing in technology for greater vaccine production calls for the creation of new flu vaccines and stockpiling antiviral drugs.<br><br> 
Ronald Blanck, DO, president of UNT Health Science Center at Fort Worth, can comment on President Bush‰Ûªs plan to fight avian influenza. Dr. Blanck served as the Army‰Ûªs Surgeon General and commander of the U.S. Army Medical Command. He is a world-renowned expert in the spread of infectious diseases and is currently consulting to put together an avian influenza response plan. He can speak about vaccinations and how the United States is preparing for the possible spread of the avian flu.<br><br>
Dr. Blanck says that planning for worst case scenarios is important, but that people shouldn‰Ûªt overreact to the possibility of an epidemic.<br><br> 
‰ÛÏEven if this strain of influenza reaches epidemic proportions, we have far more tools to deal with it than existed in 1918-1919,‰Û Dr. Blanck said. ‰ÛÏWe certainly need to plan and have measures in place to deal with the worst case, but we should not overreact.‰Û<br><br>
Dr. Blanck emphasizes the use of simple precautions to help alleviate spread of the avian virus.<br><br>
‰ÛÏSimple measures, such as handwashing and avoiding large crowds need to be emphasized as well as using vaccines, personal protection such as masks and anti-viral agents.‰Û<br><br>
Dr. Blanck continues to be consulted as an advisor on bioterrorism issues and an expert in preparing the medical community to respond to mass casualty incidents or those involving weapons of mass destruction. In addition to his many speaking engagements and advisory positions, he now chairs task forces on bioterrorism for both the Texas Medical Association and the American Osteopathic Association.<br><br>
Dr. Blanck has appeared in various media as an expert on the spread of infectious diseases and medical preparedness.<br><br>

-Minority Recruitment. The health science center has supported many programs that have contributed to its success in recruiting minority students. UNTHSC has been the leading health science center in Texas in graduate minority enrollment every year since 1999. In 1999, the Clinton administration listed UNTHSC as a Program of Excellence on their Initiatives on Race website, and in 2001, the Bush administration recognized the health science center with the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science Mentoring, a program administered by the National Science Foundation. In addition, it has been recognized as a Role Model Institution since 2000 by Minority Access Inc., an NIH affiliate organization.<br><br>

The award recognizes one CME activity each year that most effectively illustrates a genuine partnership between a CME provider and an industry supporter. PACE received the award for <i>Changing Course: Diagnosing & Treating Type II Diabetes</i>, a DVD-based activity released in 2005.<br><br>
‰ÛÏThis award is a great honor,‰Û said Pam McFadden, associate vice president of PACE. ‰ÛÏTo know you did a great job is one thing, but to be recognized by your peers and such a respected organization as the ACME is on a completely different level. Each one of my staff members played a role in this project, and each person shares in this award.‰Û<br><br>
<i>Changing Course </i>was funded with an educational grant from the sanofi-aventis group, a Bridgewater, New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company. ‰ÛÏWe worked closely with sanofi-aventis to make this project a reality, especially Dr. Kent Porter, a metabolism regional medical manager from Medical Affairs,‰Û McFadden said. ‰ÛÏDr. Porter provided us with late-breaking scientific information over the course of the development phase and objective feedback when we asked him to review portions of the edited video. He respected our need for autonomy and independence, but contributed to this scientifically-sound and clinically relevant continuing education activity while staying well within all CME guidelines.‰Û<br><br>
<i>Changing Course</i> is an innovative CME activity targeted to primary care offices. Some of the nation‰Ûªs leading experts in type 2 diabetes were interviewed about the disease for the DVD. Their responses were compiled to help primary care offices better diagnose and treat patients with diabetes.<br><br>
More than 1000 DVD kits have been distributed around the country, with each one offering up to six hours of CME credit for an unlimited number of health professionals.<br><br> 
Earlier this year, the activity was awarded the bronze medal in the CME category at the international conference of the Health Sciences Communications Association in Seattle.<br><br>
The Alliance for Continuing Medical Education is the international association for CME professionals. The award will be presented on Jan. 25 at the Alliance‰Ûªs 2006 annual CME provider conference in San Francisco.<br><br>
The Office of Professional and Continuing Education at UNT Health Science Center registers more than 18,000 healthcare professionals at more than 600 activities throughout the United States each year.<br><br>
PACE is one of only seven providers in the country that are nationally accredited by both the Accreditation Council on Continuing Medical Education and the American Osteopathic Association.<br><br>
During its last accreditation cycle, PACE received Accreditation with Commendation from the ACCME for its exemplary procedures and processes and a perfect score from the AOA.<br><br>
PACE also maintains providership status by the Texas Nurses Association, the National Commission for Health Educator Credentialing, Texas State Board of Social Worker Examiners and has formed strategic alliances to educate pharmacists and other members of the healthcare team.<br><br>

Faculty, staff and students continue to man a station at the Will Rogers providing medical care while Fort Worth awaits another wave of evacuees.<br><br>
""We'll be available as long as we're needed,"" said TCOM Dean Marc B. Hahn, DO, who was one of the attending physicians this past weekend.<br><br>
On the health science center campus, several organizations have begun benefits to raise money or get donations to help aid Hurricane Katrina victims.<br><br> What follows is a list of ways to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina.<br><br>
The Forensic Investigative Research & Education Group (FIRE) is now accepting clothing donations. They will send the clothing donations to the Salvation Army shelter in Dallas Sept. 9.  Donation boxes are located in the atrium, Kiva lounge, the Stairwell CafÌ©, and the first floor lobby of the Center for BioHealth building. For more information, e-mail the group at FIRE@hsc.unt.edu.<br><br> 
The Employee Benefits Action Committee will place buckets in the atrium of the Education and Administration Building and the Stairwell CafÌ© to collect monetary donations for Hurricane Katrina victims. Money will be picked up on a daily basis.<br><br> 
The Office of Student Affairs and the Public Student Health Association (PSHA) will hold a pizza fundraiser from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., Sept. 16 in the atrium at the health science center. People will be able to purchase a slice of pizza and a soft drink for $5.  All money raised will go to the American Red Cross Hurricane Relief Effort.<br><br>
The Chisholm Trail Chapter of the Red Cross needs volunteers. An orientation training session will take place at 9 a.m. Sept. 3. There is a need for local volunteers to staff shelters, work the phone banks as well as disaster site volunteers. Call 817-336-8718 for more information.<br><br>


UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs regularly scheduled blood drive has been moved to Sept. 6 to address the immediate need for blood in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.<br><br> 
The original blood drive was scheduled for Sept. 13, but health science center officials moved the drive to Sept 6 to respond to critical needs. Collection hours will be 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the Atrium of the Education and Administration Building on the health science center campus.<br><br>
‰ÛÏWe know how caring the Fort Worth community is, and we urge everyone who can to donate blood,‰Û said Ronald Blanck, DO, health science center president.<br><br>
As the damage from Hurricane Katrina continues to mount, community blood supplies in the affected areas are declining rapidly due to the inability to collect and process blood donations. Because of the current and lasting impact of Hurricane Katrina, these community blood centers anticipate needing assistance for up to three weeks as the areas recover.<br><br> 
The blood drive on the health science center campus is in association with Carter BloodCare. A donor must wait 56 days between donations. Donations will help ensure that Carter BloodCare meets local need and provides assistance in the areas hardest hit by the hurricane.<br><br>

            More than 125 teenagers from Germany, Japan, Italy, Swaziland, Hungary, Mexico and Fort Worth are taking part in the International Leadership Academy, sponsored by Fort Worth Sister Cities International.  These high school students‰ÛÓchosen for their outstanding academic and personal achievements-- develop leadership skills and learn how technology can and will impact the future while discussing the responsibility that goes along with scientific advances.<br><br>
 
            On Thursday, July 28, a group of the teens will visit the UNT Health Science Center in Fort Worth.<br><br>
 
            The health science center event will offer a wide array of experiences for the young people:<br>

-Students will visit the simulation lab, where a dummy patient will present symptoms and allow students to assess and diagnose his condition <br>
-They‰Ûªll get a first-hand look at the gross anatomy lab, where dissection is guided by a computer<br>
‰ÛÒ        They‰Ûªll receive an exciting introduction to DNA technology in the Texas Missing Persons DNA database and lab, located at the health science center<br>
‰ÛÒ        They‰Ûªll meet and watch McNair Post-Baccalaureate Scholars ‰ÛÒ some of them international students‰ÛÓas they make presentations.<br><br>
 
            One goal of Thursday‰Ûªs visit is to encourage participants to consider the impact of technology on medicine.  This could have a direct and meaningful impact on the lives of many people.  For instance, one of the students -- 17-year old Nomthandazo ‰ÛÏTee‰Û Mdouli ‰ÛÒ is from Mbabane, Swaziland.  The AIDS epidemic has left her country in crisis and medical professionals (doctors, caregivers, program administrators) are desperately needed.  Recent figures indicate more than a third of Swaziland‰Ûªs adult population (38 percent of adults aged 15-49) are infected with AIDS or HIV.<br><br> 
 
            This is where the program‰Ûªs emphasis on medical technology is so important ‰ÛÒ and the University of North Texas Health Science Center offers such a rich response to that theme.  As in all of their experiences during the Fort Worth gathering, students and facilitators will talk about the responsible use of such technology in the global community. <br><br>  
 
            The teenagers ‰ÛÒ who range in age from 14 to 19-years old ‰ÛÒ are meeting with local leaders in healthcare, transportation and communications and learning first-hand about the exciting opportunities technology offers in each of these fields.  In addition to their classroom experiences and their field trips, students are soaking up Texas culture and building friendships with their hosts and each other.  During their two-week stay, 65 Fort Worth families are opening their homes to the visiting students and their teachers.<br><br>

            The new microscope is highly sensitive, allowing scientists to use it in low-light settings.<br><br> 
            ‰ÛÏTraditionally, cells seen under a computer microscope must be illuminated using lights in order to see detail,‰Û said Dr. Borejdo, professor of molecular biology and immunology. ‰ÛÏThe light can kill the cells, rendering them useless for further research. This new microscope is more sensitive, allowing cells to be seen with little light.‰Û<br><br>
            The new microscope converts images differently, going from photons to pulses of electricity rather than photons to voltage, Borejdo said. ‰ÛÏThis conversion method is more efficient and brings the cost of the microscope down.‰Û<br><br>
            Dr. Borejdo‰Ûªs business partners include Optical Finesse, a computer programming company in Boulder, Colo., and LSM Technology, a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania.<br><br>

            STTR is a three-phase program that takes an idea from planning to fruition. Phase I awards up to $100,000 for one year to explore the scientific, technical and commercial feasibility of an idea. Phase II awards up to $750,000 for as long as two years of continued research and development, focusing on the commercial potential of the idea. Only Phase I award winners are considered for Phase II awards. Phase III, which includes no funding, moves the innovation from the lab into the marketplace where the company can seek private or other government funding.<br><br>

            The conference, which was part of the Consortium for the Assessment of Research on Progestins and Estrogens, brought together some of the top researchers in the field of estrogen and hormone therapy.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThe chapters in the text underscore the need to do additional research and suggest that we should by no means rule out the possibility of future forms of hormone therapy,‰Û Dr. Singh said.<br><br>
Some of the questions explored in the book include:<br>
      -What is the therapeutic window for hormone therapy and/or estrogen therapy?<br>
      -What are the appropriate formulations of hormone therapy and estrogen therapy?<br>
        -What should be considered the most appropriate design for clinical trials that address the efficacy of hormone therapy and estrogen therapy?<br>
      -What are appropriate surrogate markers of neurological decline or impairment?<br><br>

Chapters by Drs. Singh and Simpkins also address the ability of hormones to protect the brain from cognitive decline. Another researcher from the health science center, Anna Ratka, PhD, PharmD, RPh, associate professor of pharmacology and neuroscience, also contributed a chapter to the book as well.<br><br>
Dr. Ratka‰Ûªs chapter discusses the possible role of hot flashes in the cognitive decline of women as they age and looks at the use of estrogen to help reduce that cognitive decline.<br><br>
The chapter in the book written by Dr. Singh, addresses how progesterone protects the brain to keep it healthy during the aging process.<br><br>
The chapter in the book written by Dr. Simpkins, addresses alternatives to existing estrogens and how those alternatives can be used in the treatment of Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease.<br><br>
‰ÛÏThis book is the definitive thesis that addresses the controversy as to whether hormones are good or bad for women,‰Û Dr. Singh said.<br><br>
The controversy involving hormone therapy for menopause started with a report issued by the Women‰Ûªs Health Initiative three years ago. The report indicated that combination menopausal hormone therapy resulted in unexpectedly greater health risks than benefits, while failing to improve quality of life for postmenopausal women.<br><br>
‰ÛÏRegrettably, that‰Ûªs not the whole story,‰Û Dr. Singh said.<br><br>
Studies done by Drs. Singh and Simpkins as well as others have looked at the results of the WHI and put them into a broader perspective.<br><br>
‰ÛÏThis book argues that hormone therapy at the time of menopause is most likely good and of very low risk,‰Û Dr. Simpkins said.<br><br>
The new book is available from the New York Academy of Sciences at <A href=http://www.nyas.org>www.nyas.org</A> as a forthcoming volume.<br><br>

‰ÛÏMedical geography is a science that uses data from demographics, health care delivery and cultural behavior among other information to map out how diseases might spread,‰Û said Joseph Oppong, University of North Texas geography professor. ‰ÛÏMedical geography is providing some answers to explain the spread of infectious diseases and prevalence of degenerative diseases.‰Û<br><br> 
This summer, Fort Worth, Texas, will be the location of the largest and the longest running international gathering of medical and health geographers ‰ÛÓ the 11th International Medical Geography Symposium. The first symposium took place in Nottingham, England, in 1984. The upcoming symposium will take place July 5 ‰ÛÒ 9 (Tuesday ‰ÛÒ Saturday) in Fort Worth.<br><br>
As chair of the Association of American Geographers‰Ûª medical geography specialty group, Oppong and Texas Department of State Health Services epidemiologist Sonia Arbona are coordinating the symposium. They expect more than 200 participants worldwide to attend.<br><br>
Oppong says in addition to medical geographers, other professionals such as health care practitioners, social scientists as well as the general public will benefit from the conference.<br><br>
UNT applied economics professor Bernard Weinstein also comments about the symposium.<br><br>
‰ÛÏMedical geography is concerned with how best to allocate limited health care resources across diverse populations and regions,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs a growing field of research that has significant implications for public policy.‰Û<br><br> 
The symposium will offer a pre-conference workshop, a plenary session and special sessions. This pre-conference workshop will take place July 5 (Tuesday) at the UNT Health Sciences Center located in Fort Worth at 3500 Camp Bowie Boulevard. The workshop sessions will focus on geographical information systems ‰ÛÓ computer systems that help scientists discover why a disease is located where it is by connecting data about locations of diseases with information such as environmental factors.<br><br>
<strong>Fees for workshops are as follows:</strong><br>
            Before June 15, workshop registration will be $100 and student workshop registration will be $75, while combined workshop/symposium fee will be $250 and combined student workshop/symposium fee will be $200.<br>

She will discuss how to map populations impacted by public health threats when these threats go beyond town boundaries to affect geographic regions.<br><br> 
Cromley worked with Connnecticut‰Ûªs Department of Health to develop a GIS for public drinking water sources. She also conducted research for the CDC‰Ûªs prevention of tick-born illnesses and Lyme disease intervention program.<br><br>
Sara McLafferty, professor of geography at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, will discuss strategies for mapping health problems and for analyzing disparities in population access to health care services. Her presentation will include topics such as density mapping ‰ÛÓ creating maps that show how the intensity of cases of disease varies across a region.<br><br>
 McLafferty uses geographic tools to understand inequalities in health and social well-being in cities throughout the United States.

Created in 2000 by Senate Bill 940 of the 77th Texas Legislature, JAMP was designed to support and encourage economically disadvantaged students to go into medical careers in Texas, Leila Torres, JAMP program coordinator for the health science center, said.<br><br>
            After completion of the program, students receive scholarship money to pay tuition at any JAMP-participating medical school upon acceptance. Torres said the biggest percentage of students that are accepted into the program are minorities.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThis is good because the state wants to develop more minority physicians in hopes that they will go back to their communities and serve them,‰Û she said.<br><br> 
The students must also have a 3.25 grade point average or higher in their first 15 hours of undergraduate courses and at least a 3.0 GPA in science courses.<br><br>
JAMP faculty directors from participating universities submit two students to the program based on their qualifications and interest in medicine. Each summer, students go to various medical schools in Texas and complete a rigorous curriculum of courses.<br><br>
Within the first week alone at the health science center, JAMP students attend lectures in physiology, learn medical terms and take tours of the various labs on campus. They also receive preparation for the Medical College Admission Test through classes that review the sections that will be included on the exam and a full- length practice test given at the end of the summer.<br><br> 
All JAMP students are required to take the MCAT no later than the spring semester of their junior year.<br><br> 
By the end of the summer, the students are already several steps closer to getting into medical school than many of their peers who are also studying to be doctors.<br><br>
‰ÛÏI know that without JAMP, it would have been more of a struggle for me to get into medical school,‰Û Jose Ochoa, a McAllen native, said. ‰ÛÏI consider myself to be pretty lucky to be able to be a part of this program and meet all of these great doctors and see all of these different medical schools.‰Û <br><br>

<strong>Why:</strong> Scientists will meet at the forum to combat worldwide spread of infectious disease.<br><br>
 
<strong>Theme:</strong> In recent years, medicine and geography have combined forces for a one-two punch against the spread of infectious diseases such as SARS, AIDS/HIV and pandemic flu.<br><br>
 
<strong>When:</strong> July 5 ‰ÛÒ 9 (Tuesday ‰ÛÒ Saturday)<br><br>
 
<strong>Where:</strong> Pre-conference workshop: July 5 (Tuesday) at the UNT Health Sciences Center in Fort Worth at 3500 Camp Bowie Boulevard. Symposium: July 6 ‰ÛÒ 9 (Wednesday ‰ÛÒ Saturday) at the Fort Worth Plaza Hotel at 1701 Commerce Street. <br><br>
 
<strong>Focus of pre-conference workshop:</strong> Geographical information systems ‰ÛÒ computer systems that help scientists discover why a disease is located where it is by connecting data about locations of diseases with information such as environmental factors.<br><br>
 
<strong>Features of conference:</strong> Keynote address by Ronald Blanck, Doctor of Osteopathy and president of the UNT Health Science Center. Symposium sessions include: ""A Respiratory Risk-Scape for Children in Texas;"" ""Neighborhood differences in perception of place and health in the region of Quebec;"" and ""Migration and Geographic Clusters of Tuberculosis Strains in Tarrant County, TX."" <br><br>
 
<strong>Story ideas and camera visuals related to the symposium:</strong> Medical geography could provide information about where degenerative diseases like Parkinson are likely to exist. Reporters and photographers can obtain information and visuals at the UNT Health Science Center's Institute for Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research. Texas Academy of Math and Science students from the UNT Denton campus conduct research. Medical geographers consider how infectious diseases can spread due to lack of vaccination. Vaccinations alone are not effective unless administered to everyone. Illegal immigrants and religious objectors who forgo this preventive measure could contribute to the spread of infectious diseases. Reporters and photographers will be able to obtain visuals of children being vaccinated at Fort Worth Fire Station #15 from 1 ‰ÛÒ 4 p.m., July 3. (Sunday). The fire station is located at 3100 Azle Avenue.<br><br>

            ",,,,,348,6/2/05 0:00,HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER'S PROJECT SCORE RECEIVES FUNDING FOR CONTINUED SCIENCE EDUCATION AT AREA HIGH SCHOOLS,"When Rusty Reeves, PhD, assistant professor of cell biology and genetics, received a message from the National Science Foundation that he needed to revise the budget for Project SCORE, it was good news. Revising the budget meant that the Project SCORE grant would likely be renewed. But it took several months before Dr. Reeves received the official news.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏGK-12‰Û Project SCORE: Development of a Permanent Outreach Partnership between Teaching Fellows and Science Teachers/Students of the Fort Worth Independent School District was refunded from May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2006, receiving a total of $471,837. The grant began in March 2002 and will total close to $2 million for the life of the grant.<br><br>
            The grant provides eight stipends for graduate students and two undergraduate fellows from Texas Wesleyan University to be paired with a high school teacher in a fellowship program. These fellows spend 10 hours per week in the classroom teaching high school science students, which is a benefit to graduate students at the health science center, according to Dr. Reeves, who taught high school biology for six years in Waxahachie.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThere is very little opportunity for our graduate students to learn about teaching, so this program allows them to do that by teaching ninth and tenth grade students,‰Û Dr. Reeves said.<br><br>
Fort Worth high schools that participate in Project SCORE are Amon Carter-Riverside, North Side, Dunbar, Paschal, Eastern Hills and South Hills. The high schools have high minority populations averaging 85%, which is also a component of the grant ‰ÛÒ trying to improve minority student scores on the science component of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills examination.<br><br>
According to Dr. Reeves, about 120 programs like Project SCORE exist throughout the United States, and in the last 10 years, science scores have been going up on standardized tests.<br><br>
‰ÛÏThat‰Ûªs a drastic change, because they had been going down,‰Û Dr. Reeves said. ‰ÛÏPersonally, I think it‰Ûªs because of these programs.‰Û<br><br>
Project SCORE, Track II, which is the renewed grant, will include Reeves as principal investigator. Co-principal investigators for the grant will include Harold Sheedlo, PhD, associate professor of cell biology and genetics; Robert Kaman, JD, PhD; Mary Anne Clark, PhD, biology department at Texas Wesleyan University; Dorothy Thomas, MS, Fort Worth ISD‰Ûªs program director for science education. Gary Scott, MS, will serve as program manager of the grant.<br><br> 
The goals of Project SCORE are to prepare fellows to serve as resources for ninth grade biology students and teachers in FWISD, to enhance the appreciation and understanding of science processes throughout FWISD‰Ûªs science curriculum, and to ensure that NSF-supported SCORE program becomes a permanent part of the health science center culture.<br><br>

            James Simpkins, PhD, principal investigator for the program project grant, ‰ÛÏDiscovery of Novel Drugs for Alzheimer‰Ûªs Disease,‰Û was notified of the award continuation in February by the National Institute on Aging.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm very excited,‰Û said Dr. Simpkins, who is also chairman of the pharmacology and neuroscience department at the health science center. ‰ÛÏThis is very important research. That‰Ûªs why we‰Ûªve been doing it now for 14 years. The hope is that one or more of the compounds that we‰Ûªve been working on for more than a decade will get into and through clinical trials and will become part of the options for treating or preventing Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease. If that‰Ûªs the case, then the public investment in this program will have been worthwhile.‰Û<br><br>
            Thus far, research from the program project grant has spawned patents in several countries, including the United States and Japan, as well as a European patent. Migenix, Inc. of Vancouver, British 
Colombia, holds the licensing for some of the compounds discovered so far as a part of the grant.<br><br>
            Peter Koulen, PhD, associate professor in the department of pharmacology and neuroscience at the health science center, also serves on the grant. Dr. Koulen is principal investigator of core C, which is the neuroimaging core, and principal investigator of project 5, which will focus on the role of calcium in the development of Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏMy role in this project is also to coordinate with the project investigators and principal investigators of other projects,‰Û Dr. Koulen said. ‰ÛÏThat‰Ûªs one of the beauties of this program project. We‰Ûªre not just an array of four independent NIH grants; we also have certain mechanisms built into this project that allow us, when we are finding interesting things in our area, to apply that to the other areas, and we advance and move into another direction. So the overall project is more than its individual components.‰Û<br><br>
            The core facility that Dr. Koulen will be running at the health science center will validate the results of other projects. Dr. Simpkins will run core A, the administrative core, at the health science center. Other cores include core B, the vector core, housed at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and core D, the drug synthesis core, housed at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.<br><br> 
            ‰ÛÏThese cores provide support for every one of the research activities,‰Û Dr. Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏThey are pretty unique to program project grants.‰Û<br><br>
            The grant also contains four projects, including those of Dr. Simpkins and Dr. Koulen. The project headed by Dr. Simpkins is a continuation of research on the use of non-feminizing estrogen to treat Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease. The project headed by Edwin M. Meyer, PhD, at the University of Florida in Gainesville will work to develop nicotinic compounds to use as novel gene therapies for treatment of Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease. The project headed by Michael A. King, PhD, at the University of Florida in Gainesville will study and develop the vectors for Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease modeling and therapy.<br><br>
‰ÛÏEach of the grant components is developing drugs or technology for their potential to treat Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease,‰Û Dr. Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏThis program, unlike most academic programs, has resulted in, to date, two compounds being in clinical trials. That‰Ûªs very unusual for an academic setting. And that‰Ûªs one of the reasons that this program has been sustained, now for 14 years. We understand Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease better. We understand better potential therapies, and we have delivered some of those drugs to clinical trials.‰Û<br><br>
            This program project grant is the second program project grant that the department of pharmacology and neuroscience has received from the NIH. The first grant, which is ongoing, supports the study of the effects of normal aging on the brain. Dr. Simpkins and Dr. Koulen are part of that program project grant as well.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThere are probably only a dozen academic departments in the country that can make the claim that they have two program project grants,‰Û Dr. Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏSo I think that‰Ûªs an indicator of the national status of this department.‰Û<br><br>
            According to Dr. Koulen, the infrastructure and support of the health science center have been integral to receiving the two program project grants.<br><br>
             ‰ÛÏI think one of the reasons why this is possible is that we have highly interactive departments and researchers within departments, and we have an administration that encourages this kind of collaborative research,‰Û Dr. Koulen said.
            With continued funding from this program project grant, Dr. Simpkins believes that eventually Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease will either be prevented or cured.<br><br>

The innovative course is designed to help future physicians work on diagnostic skills by examining paintings and photographs from the museum‰Ûªs collection.<br><br>
An Eye for Detail was originally created in 2001 by the health science center and the Amon Carter based on a collaboration between the Frick Collection and the Weill-Cornell Medical School in New York. At that time, the health science center‰Ûªs course was offered to first- and second-year medical students on a voluntary basis. Beginning this year, first-year medical students are required to enroll in An Eye for Detail as part of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine curriculum at the health science center.<br><br>
‰ÛÏBy looking at art, students learn to observe, describe and interpret what they are seeing,‰Û said Bruce Dubin, DO, JD, associate dean of medical education. ‰ÛÏThey then translate this into the clinical setting using non-verbal cues to determine a patients‰Ûª mental and physical well-being.‰Û<br><br>
During the course, students look at approximately five portraits in the Amon Carter Museum galleries. The portraits range from photography to oil paintings. Students are instructed to use visual 
clues from the portraits to make conclusions about the person‰Ûªs age, ethnicity, health, mood, personality, socioeconomic status and occupation.<br><br> 
The course is facilitated by museum staff members, working with groups of seven to eight students, who share their findings in large group discussions. The course takes approximately five hours and includes a pre-test and post-test, using medical photography, to determine if students improved as a result of the program.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏAn Eye for Detail challenges students to utilize and strengthen their problem-solving skills, exercise their creative thinking skills, and process visual information,‰Û said Nora Christie, Amon Carter Museum tour program manager. ‰ÛÏWe believe that honing these skills early in their medical education will make them better physicians.‰Û<br><br>
            An Eye for Detail will be offered to students April 20, 21 and 22; May 6 and 27; and June 3 and 10.<br><br>

After applying for the grant twice previously, the Fort Worth Northside Community Health Center finally made the cut with its third application. On Monday, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt announced planned awards of more than $63 million for 17 grants to be awarded in May and 88 additional grants to be awarded in December. The Fort Worth Northside Community Health Center was included in the December list with an award of $650,000.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏWe are certainly excited about the announcement of this planned award,‰Û said Eddy Herrera, CEO of the Fort Worth Northside Community Health Center. ‰ÛÏThis is the first step in allowing us to truly address the health needs of the Northside community.‰Û<br><br>
            Funding for the December grants will be awarded on Dec. 1 as fiscal year 2006 funds become available; therefore, funding is contingent on the 2006 national budget.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThis is exciting news for people in Fort Worth, especially people in the Northside community,‰Û said Manuel Valdez, president of the board of directors of the Fort Worth Northside Community Health Center and justice of the peace for precinct five. ‰ÛÏThis decision was a long time coming, and it took the efforts of many people. We are very confident that the federal funding for this health center will work out for our community. The results certainly can be beneficial to the needy that may not be receiving the services they should be receiving in these hard economic times. Centers such as this will at least allow people who cannot afford health care to have some preventive care‰ÛÓthat is our intent as a board that the federal funding will allow us to expand our capacity to serve the citizens of this community.‰Û<br><br>
            The grants from HHS will allow the Fort Worth Northside Community Health Center to offer comprehensive primary health care services to patients regardless of their ability to pay. According to HHS, almost 40 percent of patients treated at federal health centers have no insurance coverage, and others have inadequate coverage, so charges for health care services are set according to income.<br><br>
            The grants announced by HHS Secretary Leavitt are part of President George Bush‰Ûªs five-year initiative to help communities across the country create or expand access to comprehensive primary health care services. The initiative was launched in 2002. Since then, HHS has funded more than 700 new or expanded health centers.<br><br>
            The grant awarded to Fort Worth Northside Community Health Center was one of nine awarded to Texas communities as part of the December funding. One grant for announced in the May round of funding.<br><br>  
            According to a fact sheet from the National Association of Community Health Centers, total funds for community health centers come from a mix of federal grants (26%), patient-related revenue (55.6%), non-federal grants (13%) and other sources (19%).<br><br> 
The Northside Community Clinic was originally an extension of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine‰Ûªs  Northside clinic facility. It is located at 2106 N. Main Street in Fort Worth.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏBy partnering with the community and with the JPS Health Network, we have more effectively reached out to an underserved population in the near Northside area,‰Û said Marc B. Hahn, DO, dean of TCOM. ‰ÛÏWe believe that this collaborative effort was instrumental in helping the community obtain the first federally qualified health center in Fort Worth.‰Û<br><br>

            This is the fourth year in a row that TCOM has been ranked in the top 50 medical schools for primary care.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏIn the last four years, we have garnered national recognition in medical education with some leading-edge efforts in curriculum reform, the use of medical simulation for training, and a unique rural track program to train physicians for rural Texas,‰Û said Marc B. Hahn, DO, dean of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine.<br><br>
            The ranking for 2005 was lower than last year‰Ûªs 26th place ranking for primary care. Dr. Hahn said that this year‰Ûªs drop in ranking may have been affected by the confusion brought about when the Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas closed and the loss of several of our affiliated residency training programs.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏIn addition to our undergraduate medical education initiatives, Fort Worth‰Ûªs medical school continues to work in partnership with Plaza Medical Center in Fort Worth as a partner in their residency training programs in family medicine and internal medicine,‰Û Dr. Hahn said. ‰ÛÏTCOM also has ties to many other graduate training programs throughout Texas.‰Û<br><br>
            Each year, U.S. News ranks professional-school programs in business, education, engineering, law and medicine. The rankings are based on expert opinion about program quality and statistical indicators that measure the quality of the school‰Ûªs faculty, research and students.<br><br>
            To gather the opinion data, U.S. News and World Report surveyed deans, program directors and senior faculty to judge the academic quality of programs in their field on a scale of 1, which was marginal, to 5, which was outstanding. Professionals who hire new graduates were also surveyed for the rankings.<br><br>
            This year in the medical school category, the total dollar amount of research grants awarded per full-time science and clinical faculty member from the National Institutes of Health was added to the methodology although the greatest weight for the rankings was still given to peer ratings.<br><br>

Fernando TreviÌ±o, PhD, executive director of the American Public Health Association from 1993 to 1996, was at the signing ceremony that day, enjoying in one moment what took him an entire year to accomplish.<br><br>
This year, the 10th anniversary of National Public Health Week, Dr. TreviÌ±o remembers his involvement with the proclamation. Dr. TreviÌ±o became the founding dean of the UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs School of Public Health five years ago.<br><br>
On his office wall at the health science center is one of the original five proclamations signed by Bill Clinton.<br><br>
Dr. TreviÌ±o said that the impetus for the proclamation came from Dr. Caswell Evans, who was the president of APHA at the time. Dr. Evans was the director of the Los Angeles Public Health Department and had started Public Health Week in Los Angeles. The initiative went statewide, and so when Dr. Evans became president of APHA, he requested Dr. TreviÌ±o‰Ûªs help in making Public Health Week a national event.<br><br>
‰ÛÏHe approached me and said the one thing that he wanted to get done as part of his term was to 
get a National Public Health Week,‰Û Dr. TreviÌ±o said. ‰ÛÏSo we went to work on that. I got my government relations people to start talking to Donna Shalala, and we worked it for a year. We got her support, and then we went up to the president. Both of them agreed that it would be a good way to bring attention to public health.‰Û<br><br>
Later during his tenure as executive director of the APHA, Dr. TreviÌ±o was also elected president of the World Federation of Public Health Associations, where he worked to build bridges and increase the visibility of public health worldwide.<br><br> 
‰ÛÏI started telling other countries what we were doing to increase the visibility of public health,‰Û Dr. TreviÌ±o said. ‰ÛÏWhat I found was that it doesn‰Ûªt matter if it‰Ûªs Czechoslovakia, Nigeria or China, the public really doesn‰Ûªt understand public health, so the other countries were really trying to emulate the American approach.‰Û<br><br>
In looking back on his time as executive director of the American Public Health Association, Dr. TreviÌ±o points to the increased awareness of public health and increased funding of public health as successes.<br><br>
‰ÛÏBack then, public health was really unknown by most people,‰Û Dr. TreviÌ±o said. ‰ÛÏI think that maybe one percent of the population could correctly identify what public is.  One of the things that was really positive that I remember was the American Medical News (the newspaper of the American Medical Association) reported right at the end, after the Clinton administration was unable to reform healthcare, that the one winner out of all of the debate had been public health because, in fact, the public knew much more about public health and how important it was, and so did healthcare workers.‰Û<br><br>
When Dr. TreviÌ±o left the APHA in 1996, he went back to university life. Shortly after, he 
helped start the health science center‰Ûªs School of Public Health.<br><br> 
Since that day 10 years ago, Dr. TreviÌ±o has left the planning of National Public Health Week to officials at APHA at the national level and students at the local level, but it was his hard work 10 years ago that has spawned a national tradition that will be celebrated this year April 3-9.<br><br>

            Santiago‰Ûªs dissertation reviewed research on advance directives in the United States and studied of  Mexican-Americans in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex to determine the level of knowledge; attitudes; and cultural, religious and family influences on decisions regarding advance directives and living wills.<br><br> 
Her study included two focus groups of people who she interviewed for two and one-half hours. One group consisted of elderly Mexican-Americans who had been hospitalized or participated in home-healthcare programs within the past year. The other group included family members or caregivers of elderly people who had been hospitalized or participated in home-healthcare in the past year.<br><br> 
Santiago discovered lack of knowledge and confusion in both groups regarding advance directives. Some participants thought that the term living will meant the distribution of property. Religiosity and education did have some bearing on the respondents‰Ûª attitudes toward advance directives, according to the study, and the elderly participants were more likely to allow adult children to make decisions about extended life care.<br><br>           
‰ÛÏTerri Schiavo‰Ûªs case is a sad example of the difficulties families must go through when a loved one does not have a living will,‰Û Santiago said. ‰ÛÏDuring my practice as a provider of home health and hospice services, primarily among Hispanics, the experience of encountering similar situation, that is family members‰Ûª disagreements regarding what is the will of the dying loved one, led me to do this study.‰Û<br><br>
Santiago is founder and CEO of Cuidado Casero Home Health & Hospice.<br><br>

Solis had been reported missing by her family after she never made it to school on March 3, 2003. Her remains were found by crews cutting trees in a heavily wooded area about 50 feet from the Brazos River in August.<br><br>
A sample of the remains were sent to UNTHSC‰Ûªs DNA Identity Laboratory in October 2003 where they were analyzed using both mitochondrial and STR DNA systems. The results from the analysis were loaded in November 2004 into the FBI‰Ûªs Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) Missing Person‰Ûªs Database. UNTHSC was the first lab in the country to receive the FBI‰Ûªs CODISmp software that allows comparison of DNA samples from family members of missing persons with samples from unidentified bodies. The CODISmp software was not fully operational until summer 2004.<br><br>
Samples were also taken from Solis‰Ûª mother and father in and loaded into the CODISmp software, which matched the remains found in August 2003. The lab first learned of the possible DNA match in late November 2004. Further testing was required before releasing the information to police this month, said Arthur Eisenberg, PhD, director of the DNA Identity Lab.<br><br>
‰ÛÏThis is only the third time a DNA lab in the United States has matched DNA and human remains using the CODISmp software,‰Û Eisenberg said. ‰ÛÏWe have made two of those three identifications. We are ecstatic that we are able to help bring some closure to families who are awaiting word on missing loved ones.‰Û<br><br>
The state legislature established the Texas Missing Persons DNA Database in 2001 on the UNT Health Science Center campus with funding provided by the Attorney General‰Ûªs Crime Victims‰Ûª Compensation Fund. The database began accepting samples from Texas law enforcement agencies in March 2003. Texas was the first state in the country with a Missing Persons DNA Database capable of analyzing both Mitochondrial and STR systems. The database provides a very powerful tool for investigators trying to locate missing persons or identify remains. The DNA analysis provided by the Texas Missing Persons DNA Database is at no charge to law enforcement agencies or the families. <br><br>
The health science center‰Ûªs DNA Identity Lab has provided scientific and technical support for Texas law enforcement agencies and crime labs for more than 10 years, including paternity testing, forensic genetic screening and DNA testing. The lab is one of only a handful of facilities that are able to conduct mitochondrial forensic DNA analysis and is currently one of two state laboratories that can submit mitochondrial DNA profiles directly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

His natural curiosity seemed to grow out of a need to know why things circulated the way they did.<br /><br />             In his youth, it was the circulation of fish in a pond that fascinated Farias. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;d go fishing, I&rsquo;d make a mark with the hook on the fish to see if I could catch it again. I always wondered where it would be the next day,&rdquo; Farias said. &ldquo;Actually, one time I did catch the same fish about a month later.&rdquo;<br /><br />             That affinity toward circulation grew as he matured, and Farias himself circulated. Born in Brownsville, Farias moved to San Antonio for his undergraduate education, earning a bachelor of arts degree in biology from Our Lady of the Lake University.<br /><br />             &ldquo;I went there because it was a small campus,&rdquo; Farias said. &ldquo;You get one-on-one contact with the professors.&rdquo;<br /><br />             From San Antonio, Farias made his way back to the University of Texas at Brownsville and a cooperative training program between the University of Texas at Brownsville and the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.<br /><br />             It was during his years at the health science center that Farias&rsquo; abiding interest in circulation became a passion. Now what fascinates Farias is circulation of a different type&mdash;coronary circulation.<br /><br />                        His research at the health science center resulted in publications in the <em>American Journal of Physiology </em>and his PhD in physiology. Farias also earned a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Washington&rsquo;s Department of Physiology, where he has continued his research on coronary circulation, resulting in several other publications.<br /><br />             In addition to his natural curiosity, what has driven Farias is his dedication to educational access and opportunities for minority students. For these efforts, Farias was named a Minority Access National Alumnus Role Model Award winner at the Role Models Award Banquet in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />             &ldquo;Dr. Farias symbolizes Minority Access&rsquo; ideal alumnus role model&mdash;one who has made significant contributions to biomedical research and can be viewed as a role model to minority students,&rdquo; said Andrea Mickle, president and chief executive officer of Minority Access Inc.<br /><br />             Minority Access Inc. is a non-profit educational organization that supports individuals; institutions; federal, state and local governmental agencies; and various corporations to diversify campuses and work sites by improving the recruitment, retention and enhancement of minorities.<br /><br />  The Role Models&rsquo; Conference was created from a cooperative agreement between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; National Institutes of Health and Minority Access Inc. to focus national attention on people who have excelled in producing and supporting minority researchers, particularly in the biomedical sciences and health-related fields.<br /><br /> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really honored to receive this award,&rdquo; Farias said. &ldquo;My goal is to become a professor and perform cardiovascular research. I also think it is important to create more opportunities of access for minorities.&rdquo;<br /><br /> Robert Kaman, JD, PhD, associate dean and director of outreach for the health science center, praised Farias&rsquo; dedication to giving back to minority students. Kaman was instrumental in recruiting Farias into the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Bridges to the Doctorate Degree program.<br /><br />  &ldquo;Martin Farias continues to be a fine example of the American Dream in education--where hard work and dedication allow young men and women from all backgrounds to achieve the highest level of scholarship that our society has to offer,&rdquo; Kaman said. &ldquo;But Martin has gone further than just achieving his own lofty goals--from the beginning of our association he has continued to reach back, encourage and assist those students who are following him. He has raised the bar for those students in both science and society, and his success in each inspires them, as well as those faculty who have been fortunate enough to know him.&rdquo;<br /><br /> Farias, his wife Valerie and their children currently live in Washington, but they will be circulating to Louisiana Sate University Health Science Center this summer for Martin&rsquo;s second post-doctoral fellowship.<br /><br />  The two met at the Founders&rsquo; Activity Center on the health science center campus when Valerie was working in the pediatrics department. Valerie is from Saginaw, and her parents, Cleto and Rosa Salazar, still live in Saginaw, so a return to the area might be in the future for the Fariases and a position at the health science center is not out of the question.<br /><br /> &ldquo;That would be nice, to come back,&rdquo; Farias said.<br /><br /> ###<br /><br /> <strong>Contact:</strong> Kay Colley 817-735-2553, cell 817-980-5090, e-mail <a href=""mailto:"">kacolley@hsc.unt.edu</a>.",,,,,288,2/16/05 0:00,UNTHSC FOUNDATION NAMES NEW BOARD MEMBERS FOR 2005,"The University of North Texas Health Science Center Foundation has named four community leaders to serve on its Board of Directors for 2005.<br><br>

            The program is to provide seed money for researchers, according to Glenn Dillon, PhD, associate vice president of research and biotechnology.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThis seed money should enhance more collaborative research projects that could lead to major federal funding and provide innovative approaches for treating major diseases,‰Û Dr. Dillon said.<br><br>       
The idea for the joint institutional seed research program came from Bob Gracy, PhD, associate vice president of research alliance development, and Ron Elsenbaumer, vice president of research at the University of Texas at Arlington. The idea was to encourage collaboration across institutions and to help researchers prepare applications for federal grants.<br><br>
            Initially, the amount of funding for the program was set at $50,000, but the final tally resulted in a budget of $68,885.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏFunding for the program was originally set at $50,000, but because of the originality and quality of the applications, additional funds were committed to the joint program,‰Û Dr. Dillon said.<br><br>
            Fifteen proposals were reviewed by a joint review panel from both institutions, 

comprised of faculty members who were not involved in any of the submitted proposals. Members were appointed by Elsenbaumer at Arlington and Dr. Dillon at the health science center. Proposals were scored based on a set of pre-determined values.<br><br>
            Five proposals were funded from the 15 proposals that were submitted.<br><br> 
            The award period for the grants is from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2005. During the grant period, if a joint federal grant proposal is submitted relating to the funded project or as an outcome of the project, a bonus will be provided to the grant recipients.<br><br>

            The property was purchased by Robert Patton Tuesday at a foreclosure auction. Ronald Blanck, DO, president of the health science center, began negotiations with Patton shortly after the purchase. Negotiations continued through today.<br><br>  
            The agreement reached today stipulates that the health science center will close on the property prior to or on April 1.<br><br>
The health science center could not purchase the property at auction because the foreclosure process does not meet various state requirements for property purchase. The state requires that a property purchased by a state entity include a title policy, survey and other similar items as a safeguard to protect taxpayer money. At a foreclosure sale, properties are purchased as is.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre very happy to work with Mr. Patton, whose appreciation of the health science center allowed us to purchase the former OMCT property for less than other offers that he had received,‰Û Dr. Blanck said.<br><br>

Dr. Blanck was given authorization to negotiate for the purchase of the former OMCT property by the UNT System Board of Regents Jan. 21 during a telephone meeting.<br><br>
            The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board then authorized Dr. Blanck to enter into negotiations for the property at its regularly scheduled meeting Jan. 27.<br><br>
            Before any plans for the property can be made, the health science center will commission a master plan.<br><br> 
            Other properties purchased by the health science center in the agreement include a clinic on University Drive, which currently houses the health science center‰Ûªs pediatrics clinic, and two properties near the main OMCT campus.<br><br>

The University of North Texas Physicians Group will merge with the North Texas Affiliated Medical Group to form a new not-for-profit organization. Both groups are currently not-for-profits. The merger will result in the largest physicians group in Tarrant County.<br><br> 
 ‰ÛÏThis merger of two major physicians groups should act as an economic stimulus for increased medical research, education and enhanced patient care, adding jobs and improving the quality of life for Tarrant County residents,‰Û said Bill Thornton, president of the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>  
The UNT Physicians Group is a 110-member physicians group affiliated with the University of North Texas Health Science Center that provides services to more than 200,000 Fort Worth-area patients yearly. Its physicians are faculty members at the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, part of the Fort Worth-based health science center.<br><br>
 ‰ÛÏWe believe that this merger will improve both the quality of and access to patient-centered care for all Tarrant County residents,‰Û said Marc B. Hahn, DO, dean of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine and chairman of the UNT Physicians Group. ‰ÛÏIn addition, the enhanced clinical faculty will offer benefits to our medical school and physician assistant programs on the health science center campus.‰Û<br><br>
The North Texas Affiliated Medical Group is a 174-member physicians group that provides service to nearly 500,000 Tarrant County residents yearly. The group has provided the majority of the medical staff at John Peter Smith Hospital and its neighborhood health centers for almost 10 years. Currently, these doctors also provide most of the training for residency programs at JPS.<br><br>
‰ÛÏAround the country, large multi-specialty groups and medical schools are at the forefront in innovation and quality improvements in medical care,‰Û said Charles Webber, MD, chairman of the North Texas Affiliated Medical Group. ‰ÛÏThe size of the combined groups as well as the affiliation with our local medical school, will put us in a position to be that sort of catalyst in Fort Worth.‰Û<br><br>
State representative Charlie Geren also sees the merger as a step in the right direction for healthcare in Tarrant County.<br><br>
‰ÛÏThe merger of these two groups creates a synergy that should positively impact the provision of healthcare in Tarrant County and the educational opportunities for our doctors of tomorrow,‰Û Rep. Geren said. ‰ÛÏI fully expect the newly formed group will continue good-faith negotiations with the Tarrant County Hospital District to insure a complete range of services are provided at JPS.‰Û<br><br> 
Some of the doctors in the new group will continue to work out of the clinics on health science center campus. Others will maintain offices at satellite locations around Tarrant County. The new group will span all specialties of medical practice and most subspecialties. For patients, that means improved access to quality healthcare.<br><br> 
 ‰ÛÏOur constituents seek increased opportunities for specialty care within our community,‰Û said Devoyd Jennings, president of the Fort Worth Metropolitan Black Chamber of Commerce. ‰ÛÏWe believe a merger that offers approximately 300 providers of medical care will allow this to happen.‰Û<br><br>
With the merger, the two physicians groups plan to tie all practices into a network of physicians that can enhance patient care by sharing medical records, care planning, and patient education.<br><br>
 ‰ÛÏWe are supportive of actions that can improve access to medical care and increase efficiency in its delivery,‰Û said Rosa Navejar, president of the Fort Worth Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. ‰ÛÏThis merger provides that opportunity.‰Û<br><br>
The new group will also provide the health science center with more clinical faculty members and researchers, promoting the health science center‰Ûªs goal to achieve excellence in education and research. For students at the medical school, that means an opportunity to learn from a wider variety of specialists.<br><br>
‰ÛÏThis is an exciting opportunity for both groups,‰Û said Ronald Blanck, DO, president of the health science center. ‰ÛÏAnd this is an exciting opportunity for our students.‰Û<br><br>
Since both physicians groups already share a commitment to education, research and patient care prior to their merger, the new group will continue that focus and deepen its community focus in an effort to provide better medical care for all Tarrant County residents.<br><br>
Business details of the merger should be finalized over a six to eight month period.<br><br>

Vishwanatha, PhD, associate dean of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at the University of North Texas Health Science Center, received an award from the Department of Defense for his studies on breast cancer therapy.<br><br>
            The award of $106,500 was part of the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program. Approximately 250 awards were given in 2004, in a peer-reviewed research process. According to Gail Whitehead, public affairs coordinator with the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program, only 14 percent of applicants received awards this year. Awards were given this year totaling $150 million.<br><br>     
            Dr. Vishwanatha‰Ûªs study, ‰ÛÏBreast Cancer Therapy with Annexin II Nanoparticles,‰Û received the Breast Cancer Research Program Concept Award. He was chosen in a double blind global competition for novel concepts in breast cancer research. Double blind means that the institution and the researcher were unidentified in the competition.<br><br>
The study is designed to determine whether the replacement of the annexin II gene, using nanoparticle technology, results in the regression of breast cancer. Annexin II is a protein that affects formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Tumor growth is dependent on new blood vessel formation. Dr. Vishwanatha's research uses a novel nanotechnology-based gene delivery method to inhibit the angiogenesis process as a way to treat breast cancer.<br><br>
Nanoparticles eliminate the problems of toxicity and immunogenicity associated with other gene therapy delivery methods because they are biologically compatible. This compatibility means there are fewer incidents of side effects caused by the therapy itself. Nanoparticles also provide sustained gene expression, eliminating the need for frequent injection of the gene therapy.<br><br>

Mallet, Ph.D., was named the 2003-2004 Outstanding Graduate Faculty Member by the student body of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. <br><br>
Dr. Mallet, associate professor of integrative physiology at the University of North Texas Health Science Center, presented a seminar about the history of his research on Thursday, Nov. 18, as part of the Outstanding Graduate Faculty Seminar Series. The seminar was titled ‰ÛÏHelp for the Aching Heart: Manipulating Metabolism to Protect the Myocardium.‰Û The seminar series was created to foster an understanding of the long-term efforts of the Outstanding Graduate Faculty Members at UNTHSC.<br><br>
Recipients of the Outstanding Graduate Faculty Member award are selected based on their commitment to the ideals of higher education, involvement in graduate education, and dedication to the student body.<br><br>
Dr. Mallet has devoted his research career to understanding how the mammalian heart‰Ûªs complex metabolism affects its blood-pumping performance and its ability to survive heart attacks. <br><br>
Studies in Dr. Mallet‰Ûªs laboratory funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute have shown that the natural carbohydrate pyruvate is a superior fuel for the heart, capable of enhancing the heart‰Ûªs performance and preventing cardiac injury. <br><br>
These studies demonstrated that pyruvate increases the heart‰Ûªs energy supply, bolsters the heart‰Ûªs antioxidant defenses and restores cardiac function following injury. <br><br>

An ongoing collaboration with Albert Olivencia-Yurvati, DO, professor of surgery, funded by the Osteopathic Heritage Foundation has extended pyruvate to clinical application; the use of pyruvate-fortified solutions prevents cardiac injury during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and hastens the post-operative recovery of the patients.  <br><br>
Collaborations with Fred Downey, PhD, professor of integrative physiology, have investigated and refined the use of hypoxia to protect the heart.  <br><br>

            In Type II Diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin, which is a hormone that allows cells to use sugar circulating in the blood. When the sugar‰ÛÓcalled glucose‰ÛÓbuilds up in the blood, it causes cells to be starved for energy and overtime may affect the eyes, kidneys or heart. Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and has no cure.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏApproximately 6 percent of the United States population is infected with diabetes,‰Û said Pam McFadden, associate vice president of professional and continuing education. ‰ÛÏOf that 18 million, about 5 million people don‰Ûªt know they have the disease. It is important that members of our health care community are able to diagnose diabetes and work with patients on treatment options.‰Û <br><br>
The training program, called ‰ÛÏChanging Course: Diagnosing & Treating Type II Diabetes,‰Û provides continuing education for nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants and physicians who provide primary care to diabetic patients. The three DVD set addresses the basics of type 2 diabetes, the latest information on diagnosis and treatment, interactive patient cases and even includes a patient education video. <br><br>
It was designed to increase communication and collaboration between members of the health care team to improve patient outcomes in type 2 diabetes.  Each disc can be used in a standard DVD player or in a computer equipped with a DVD disc drive.<br><br>
‰ÛÏThe DVD format was chosen because it truly allows a health care professional to create an individualized learning experience,‰Û McFadden said. ‰ÛÏThey can choose what they want to watch, when they want to watch it, skipping what they already know and focusing more on what they want or need
to know.‰Û <br><br>

            These graduates will be the first graduating class of Promotores de Salud Alliance, and they will work with Spanish-speaking people to help with diabetes prevention and education efforts in conjunction with the Diabetes Research, Education and Metabolic Studies project, or as it‰Ûªs commonly known, DREAMS. These graduates will spend Dec. 6 through Dec. 9 in training before their graduation ceremony Dec. 9 at noon in the atrium of the health science center.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏWhile this is the fourth group of graduates of the Salud para su Corazon of North Texas Promotores de Salud Alliance, it‰Ûªs exciting every time,‰Û said Mary Luna Hollen, PhD, RD, LD, director of the Promotores de Salud Alliance. ‰ÛÏThis new project, DREAMS, is once again utilizing the promotora community outreach train-the-trainer model that will allow us to train the promotoras, or lay health educators, about diabetes so that they can in turn educate Spanish-speaking populations in their own homes, churches, and centers.‰Û<br><br>
            Dr. Luna Hollen began the Promotores de Salud Alliance program through the health science center‰Ûªs School of Public Health in 2001. <br><br>
            The Promotores de Salud Alliance is a community outreach model. Promotoras are trained volunteers who provide health education to local Latinos in homes, churches, and community centers throughout Fort Worth and Dallas after learning how to teach others within their community ways to prevent and control disease. <br><br>
When graduates leave the health science center, their work will just be beginning, as they start the arduous task of setting up demonstrations, answering questions and getting people to change a lifetime of bad habits. The goal of the program is to change lives, reduce the risk of diabetes, and help those people who do have diabetes learn to manage it better, which begins with the outreach effort that follows graduation.<br><br>
Currently, about 18 million Americans are believed to have diabetes, which is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The disease has no cure, but can be managed with proper diet and exercise. However, diabetes can be prevented. <br><br>
According to Dr. Luna Hollen, the focus of this project will be obese Hispanic children at risk for Type II diabetes and their families.<br><br>

The event, co-sponsored by Tarrant County Public Health, Defenbaugh and Associates and the University of North Health Science Center, occurred at the Texas Motor Speedway along with hospital locations throughout the Metroplex. <br><br>
The drill, a realistic simulation of a terrorist attack, hit home with first-year medical students at the health science center who are learning to deal with the consequences of bioterrorism and natural disasters through a new class introduced this fall. The course, ‰ÛÏCore Disaster Life Support,‰Û teaches students the basic tenets of disaster support, including triage, treatment, evacuation, and recovery. <br><br>
‰ÛÏThe threat of bioterrorism has brought to the forefront the need for medical personnel to be prepared in case of emergency,‰Û said Bruce Dubin, DO, JD, associate dean for curriculum at the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine. ‰ÛÏWe selected this course to ensure that our students are ready to effectively manage care following disasters such as hurricanes, floods, chemical spills and infectious disease outbreaks.‰Û<br><br>
TCOM is the first medical school in the nation to have adopted CDLS as part of its first-year curriculum. The four-hour course is offered in a classroom setting. Students become more effective in the recognition and response to medical disasters after having completed the coursework. CDLS focuses on disaster preparedness for first responders and community health care providers, including physicians, nurses and other allied health providers. <br><br>
CDLS is one of three standardized courses developed by the National Disaster Life Support Educational Consortium, using a federal appropriation managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Members of the consortium include the American Medical Association Center for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Response, the Medical College of Georgia, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, the University of Texas School of Public Health at Houston and the University of Georgia. <br><br>
The other courses, which are targeted to emergency medical service field and hospital personnel, public health personnel and health care providers, are Basic Disaster Life Support and Advanced Disaster Life Support. <br><br>
BDLS, an eight-hour lecture course with slides, is currently offered to TCOM‰Ûªs second-year medical students. The class is an extension of CDLS, building on the principles learned. It includes information on traumatic and explosive events, nuclear and radiological weapon attacks, and chemical and biological events. <br><br>
TCOM plans to implement ADLS in the future. ADLS is a 16-hour class taught over two days. The first day includes lectures on triage, community and hospital disaster planning, media and communications during disasters, and mass facility management. The second day is the culmination of the three classes. Students apply what they have learned in hands-on practice simulations in triage, personal protective equipment and decontamination, disaster skills, and assessment and treatment of victims. <br><br>

The clinic offers the only hyperbaric chamber in Tarrant County. <br><br>
Patients with skin lesions or wounds as a result of diabetes or other ailments may find help in healing with hyperbaric treatment. The treatment is conducted in a long cylindrical chamber‰ÛÓa hyperbaric chamber‰ÛÓwhere patients are exposed to 100 percent oxygen.<br><br>
The treatment, which usually lasts about 90 minutes, increases the amount of oxygen in the blood and decreases the amount of other harmful gases, such as nitrogen or carbon monoxide. This in turn increases the amount of oxygen delivered by the blood to the infected area. The high level of oxygen prevents further tissue death and aids in the healing of the wound. <br><br>
Wounds that go untreated may fester, causing gangrene and possibly amputation.   <br><br>    
Hyperbaric treatment may also be used for other conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning, decompression sickness and burns. <br><br>
The hyperbaric chamber, located in the Patient Care Center on the health science center campus in Fort Worth, is available for patients through physician referral. Call 817-735-3300 for more information.<br><br>

The approval came in a special teleconference meeting at 9:30 a.m. <br><br>
The Texas Independent Osteopathic Physicians Association is a nonprofit physician organization certified by the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners. TIOPA, Inc., serves as a managed care credentialing and contracting organization for approximately 310 North Texas physicians and 80 UNTHSC physicians. The organization had been controlled by its sole member, Health Care of Texas, which was the holding company for Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas, prior to Tuesday‰Ûªs decision.<br><br>
When OMCT closed on Oct. 8, the Physicians Association found itself without a sponsoring organization since HCT was not able to continue as the sole member of TIOPA. The Health Science Center stepped in to offer interim management services for TIOPA to ensure business continuity for its faculty physicians and many of its local referring physicians.<br><br>
The proposal to transfer TIOPA administration to the Health Science Center was made so UNTHSC physicians would still have access to managed care credentialing and contracting. If the board of regents had failed to approve the proposal, the Health Science Center‰Ûªs faculty practice plan would have had to renegotiate many of the university‰Ûªs third-party payer contracts, causing a disruption in payments. <br><br>
‰ÛÏRoughly one-third of practice plan revenue for fiscal year 2003-04 was derived from contracts negotiated and administered by TIOPA, Inc.; therefore, any disruption in these payments would have impacted our clinical operations,‰Û said Marc B. Hahn, DO, dean of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine and chairman of the faculty practice plan. ‰ÛÏJust as important, our community physician partners are also dependent upon credentialing and contracting activities performed by TIOPA.‰Û  <br><br>
There will be no cost to the Health Science Center to begin administration of TIOPA since fees collected from physician/members will cover all day-to-day operating costs.  <br><br>
In a special evening meeting on Oct. 18, the TIOPA Board of Directors approved the administrative change proposed by the Health Science Center. An interim management agreement is currently being drafted.<br><br>

Dash. The event will take place Saturday, Oct. 30, beginning at the intersection of Clifton and West 7th Street in Fort Worth‰Ûªs Cultural District.  <br><br>          
            The D.O. Dash features a timed 5K race for adults, beginning at 9 a.m., and a 1K fun run for children, beginning at 10 a.m. Awards will be given for the top finishers in the 5K.<br><br> 
            Following the race, student groups are holding a free health fair to educate the public about childhood obesity. Parents can learn more about obesity prevention, diet and exercise. In addition, members of the American Medical Association/Texas Medical Association Medical Student Section will distribute coloring books, Spanish health literature and 100 bicycle helmets to children.<br><br>
            The helmets are provided by the Hard Hats for Little Heads program, which began this year at the Health Science Center through a $500 AMA Policy Promotion Grant. Reports show that wearing a helmet while riding a bike can reduce the chance of head injury by 85 percent, but only about 25 percent of riders wear them. 
Hard Hats for Little Heads is a helmet donation program set up by the Texas Medical Association in 1995, using funds donated by Prudential Financial and physicians and their families. Participating organizations purchase inexpensive, Snell/ANSI-approved helmets for children and receive a matching donation, of up to 50 free helmets, from the Texas Medical Association.<br><br>
            To register for the D.O. Dash, go to <a href=""http://www.active.com/event_detail.cfm?event_id=1167496"">http://www.active.com/event_detail.cfm?event_id=1167496</a>. Cost for pre-registrants is $15 for the 5K and $5 for the 1K fun run. Participants may also register the morning of the race in Parking Lot D, on Clifton Street, just north of the UNTHSC parking garage. Cost on race day is $20 for the 5K and $7 for the 1K fun run.<br><br>
D.O.s ‰ÛÓdoctors of osteopathic medicine‰ÛÓare physicians licensed to practice the full spectrum of health care. They perform surgery, deliver babies and prescribe medication in hospitals and clinics across the country. What separates them from traditional M.D.s is their holistic approach to medical treatment, which helps patients develop attitudes and lifestyles that prevent illness and uses manipulative techniques that encourage the body‰Ûªs natural ability to heal itself. <br><br>

But the University of North Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health has scheduled a program in October to get the two groups talking, at least in the same room.<br><br>
On Tuesday, Oct. 26, from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., researchers and reporters will have an opportunity to find a common language at the Fort Worth Botanical Gardens. The program, ‰ÛÏPromoting Dialogue Between Prevention Researchers and Media,‰Û will begin a day-long event sponsored by Research!America, a not-for-profit organization whose major goal is to make medical and health research a higher national priority. Keynote speaker for the event will be former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Paul Rogers. <br><br>
Rogers served from 1955 to 1979 in the U.S. House of Representatives. He chaired the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. During his 24 years in the House, Rogers spearheaded dozens of reform acts related to public health, biomedical research and health professions education. He sponsored the National Cancer Act of 1971, and he authored the Safe Drinking Water Act. In recognition of his lifelong contributions to health and the environment, the main plaza of the National Institutes of Health was designated Paul G. Rogers Plaza in 2001 by an act of Congress.<br><br>

The goal of the day-long event is to build connections between those who do the researching and those who report on the research so that they begin to speak the same language, according to Liz Trevino, of the health science center‰Ûªs School of Public Health, who is serving as a liaison to Research!America. <br><br>
A group of media representatives including Satcha Pretto of Univision, Javier Aldape of the Star-Telegram and Diario la Estrella, and Ellie Hogue of WBAP-AM will discuss how prevention research can be more widely disseminated with a panel of researchers and audience members. Deborah Ferguson of NBC 5 will serve as moderator for the panel discussion. Research panelists will include Dr. Antonio Rene of the health science center‰Ûªs School of Public Health, Dr. Thomas Yorio of the health science center‰Ûªs Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and Dr. Raul Caetano of the University of Texas School of Public Health at Houston.<br><br>
            Panelists will be asked to respond to actual case studies of when scientists interacted with the media so that researchers and reporters will be able to hear each other‰Ûªs perspective. The idea is to move both groups to a position where they do speak the same language, and they understand the needs and concerns of the other groups.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏThis partnership is a unique opportunity to bring all key players together to find better ways to protect and promote health for all citizens,‰Û said Fernando Trevino, Ph.D., MPH, dean of the School of Public Health at the health science center.<br><br>
            The program, sponsored by Research!America, has brought together the health science center‰Ûªs School of Public Health, the University of Texas School of Public Health, and the Texas A&M School of Rural Public Health. Similar programs have taken place at locations throughout the state.<br><br>
Research!America‰Ûªs media/scientist roundtable began after the release of two influential reports: ‰ÛÏWorld‰Ûªs Apart: How the Distance Between Science and Journalism Threatens America‰Ûªs Future,‰Û commissioned by the First Amendment Center, and ‰ÛÏUnlocking Our Future: Toward a New National Science Policy,‰Û released by Rep. Vernon Ehlers. The resulting media/scientist roundtable allows more concrete examples of barriers to coverage of science as well as examples of best practices in coverage that are shared in a non-interview, non-pressure setting.<br><br>
            ‰ÛÏWe are excited to be involved in this national initiative,‰Û said Dr. Ronald Blanck, president of the health science center. ‰ÛÏResearch!America polls show that Americans want more information about research and ways to prevent disease and illness. This forum gives researchers and media representatives the opportunity to find ways to get more information to the public and to speak the same language while they‰Ûªre doing that.‰Û<br><br>

The study was published in this month‰Ûªs <i>Medical Care,</i> a top journal in health management and policy.<br><br>
Researchers from the University of North Texas Health Science Center and Texas Tech Health Science Center found that Mexican-American parents have greater difficulty obtaining routine and urgent medical care for their children and have longer clinic waiting times when taking them to the doctor than non-Hispanic white parents. The researchers also found that children whose parents have lower incomes and children without health insurance experience greater problems obtaining health services. <br><br>
The study was conducted using a random sample of approximately 6,000 parents residing in West Texas.<br><br>
‰ÛÏThe health care system is not really meeting the needs of Hispanic children or their parents in a timely manner,‰Û said Ty Borders, PhD, associate professor at the University of North Texas Health Science Center, School of Public Health and lead author of the study. ‰ÛÏThe findings are pretty straightforward.‰Û
According to Dr. Borders, although the study was conducted in the western region of Texas, the findings can be applied to other parts of Texas and the nation where large Hispanic populations currently live.<br><br>
‰ÛÏHealth policy makers should consider means of improving children‰Ûªs access to needed medical care, such as further expanding the state child insurance program,‰Û Dr. Borders said. ‰ÛÏIn addition, practicing physicians may need to offer more consumer friendly services to Mexican-American parents to make it easier for their children to obtain care.‰Û<br><br>
Dr. Borders and his colleagues analyzed data collected as part of a randomly sampled group of 5,941 households in West Texas, which makes the study one of the largest studies ever conducted in the United States, using data collected on children. A questionnaire was administered using a telephone survey. The sample was taken from the geographical area covering 111 counties in West Texas, an area that spanned from the US/Mexico border on the west to approximately the center of the state on the east. The survey questionnaire response rate was 52.4%. The study, which was funded by the Centers for Disease Control, included additional questions about diabetes and other health issues.<br><br>

""We are excited about the popularity of the PA career,"" said Henry Lemke, PA-C, MMS, director of Physician Assistant Studies program. ""Last year we received over 450 applications, far exceeding the number of spaces we could offer. A limited number of available clinical training sites prevents us from increasing the class size even more.""<br><br>

<img src=/news/images/articleimages/clinicgrp.jpg style=""float:right;"" width=""355"" height=""216"" alt=""Future Eagle Range Family Medicine Center staff at groundbreaking ceremony.""><p>
At groundbreaking ceremonies May 13, University of North Texas Health Science Center President Ronald R. Blanck, D.O., announced that current residents of northwest Tarrant County should be able to take advantage of the professional services offered at the health science center‰Ûªs new Eagle Ranch Family Medicine Center as soon as this fall.</p>
<p>
‰ÛÏThe families and individuals who live in, and will move to, this rapidly growing area need conveniently located and comprehensive health care, and the physicians and professional clinical staff of our Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine will provide that,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>
The new clinic, located at 7235 Boat Club Road, is expected to open in September, and will offer family medicine services as well as subspecialty care such as internal medicine and general surgery. Dr. Jill Gramer and Dr. Yung Chen, family medicine physicians, will move their practices from the health science center‰Ûªs Saginaw Clinic.</p>
<p>
To build the new facility, the health science center entered into a long-term lease agreement and partnership with Gary Baker Construction Company of Fort Worth. The approximately 5,300-square-foot-clinic will have eight exam rooms, three minor procedure rooms, staff physician offices, a student study area and a large waiting room. Blanck said that a 5,000-square-foot Specialty Clinic is also planned for the site.
</p><p>
Dr. Marc B. Hahn, dean of the health science center‰Ûªs Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, said that the Eagle Ranch Clinic, one of eight community clinics operated by the medical school‰Ûªs Department of Family Medicine, will also be a clinical rotation site for medical students and students enrolled in TCOM‰Ûªs physician assistant studies program.

<p>The School of Public Health at the University of North Texas Health Science Center launched a new program training and educating leaders in the field of medical interpreting.</p>
<p>Healthcare providers in Tarrant County are struggling to provide effective services to the growing Latino Spanish-speaking community, but find that they often lack the resources. In response to this issue, the School of Public Health is launching a new M.P.H. concentration. Called Health Interpreting and Health Applied Linguistics, or HIHAL, the new concentration is ""a step in the right direction for providing truly adequate and effective language services in healthcare settings,"" according to Holly E. Jacobson, PhD, who is directing the new concentration.</p>
<p>The new master‰Ûªs level academic program will advance the fields of health communication and medical interpreting, facilitate health care access, and decrease health disparities.</p>
<p>The population of Tarrant County grew by 23% between 1990 and 2000, partly driven by the rapid growth of the Spanish-speaking community. Forty percent of the Latino population in the area are recent immigrants hailing from more than 20 countries, including Mexico, Puerto Rico, El Salvador, Cuba, and Colombia. Of these, 78% are predominately Spanish speaking.</p>
<p>The HIHAL concentration is the only program in the United States to prepare students from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds and interests to assume positions as professional health interpreters, linguistic researchers and leaders in the field of health applied linguistics. </p>
<p>UNTHSC is one of ten health organizations in the country selected to address the growing issue of language barriers in health care as part of <i>Hablamos Juntos: Improving Patient-Provider Communication for Latinos</i>, an initiative of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF). The RWJF-funded project at UNTHSC SPH is titled <i>HÌÁblenos de su salud</i>, and is implementing a number of new interventions to improve communication between English-speaking healthcare professionals and Spanish-speaking clients. The HIHAL concentration is one of these initiatives.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Jacobson, the status of medical interpreting in the U.S. today is dismal: research clearly indicates that medical interpreters are undertrained and overworked. They lack knowledge of the crucial aspects of the interaction that occurs between doctors and patients of different linguistic and cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>""Most medical interpreting programs that currently exist provide 40 hours or less of very basic classroom training, which isn't nearly enough for preparing competent interpreters,"" says Dr. Jacobson. The use of interpreters without adequate training has a direct, negative impact on patient care. </p>
<p>Students going through the HIHAL program are expected to complete 200 hours of interpreting hours at collaborating healthcare provider sites, including clinics of Planned Parenthood of North Texas, Mental Health Mental Retardation of Tarrant County, the American Cancer Society, Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine and Osteopathic Health Systems of Texas, and JPS Health Network.</p>
<p>The mission of HIHAL is to prepare professionals who will serve at the national level to promote rigorous, science-based standards for linguistic competence in health settings. HIHAL students will explore the interrelationship between language and health, and will delve into the complex relationship that exists between language and disease. </p>
<p>They will develop competencies in conducting language research in health settings, and will receive extensive training as health interpreters, and, in some cases, as health writers and translators. Due to the support of collaborating healthcare providers in Tarrant County, the program provides a rich environment for interpreter training and research, and opportunities for thesis topics that are not readily available in other linguistics programs. Currently, the languages covered in the program are limited to English and Spanish.</p>
<p>The program, which is expected to attract students from across the country, is unique in several aspects, including: the backing of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation <i>Hablamos Juntos </i>national program; the multidisciplinary focus of the curriculum that includes both public health and specialized linguistic/interpreting courses; its physical location in an accredited school of public health; and the collaborative partnership with diverse Hispanic-serving community agencies providing a variety of health care services. </p><p>The first cohort of HIHAL students will begin coursework in summer or fall 2004. Admissions materials are currently being accepted. Scholarships are available for a limited number of qualified applicants.

<p>The pediatrics clinic at the University of North Texas Health Science Center will debut a special program this week to encourage a love of reading in patients ages two to 12. </p>
<p>Called First Reader, the program aims to make visits to the doctor more pleasant for children and their parents, while also rewarding children for good behavior in a way that involves the entire family. </p>
<p>Patients will receive a complimentary personalized book when checking in for their appointments. Parents and children are encouraged to read the book together, easing both the frustration of waiting for their appointment and any anxiety children may have about going to the doctor. The books will be offered in English or Spanish and available in exam and waiting rooms. </p>
<p>The program will begin the first week of March, and families will receive one book per child.  Parents will then be asked to bring books back for subsequent clinic visits to continue the goals of the First Reader program. Of the 10,500 children the clinic sees annually, about 1,000 of them will receive First Reader books, said Al Neyland, assistant to the chair of pediatrics. For many, their First Reader book may be the first one they own.</p>
<p>The Pediatrics Clinic hopes the First Reader program will also encourage families to regularly schedule immunizations and health checks, Neyland said.. Over half of the children who visit the clinic each year live at or below the poverty level, so they may not receive regular or preventative health care clinic visits. </p>
<p>The program was made possible through a gift from the Virginia and Robert Hobbs Charitable Trust of Fort Worth. </p>

More than a fourth of BusinessWeek‰Ûªs June 2002 ‰ÛÏTop 100 Growth Companies‰Û list are medical and biomedical technology companies. Cities around the nation are vying for a piece of the biotechnology industry, and the Dallas-Fort Worth area is no exception.</p>
<p>A business development team composed of representatives from the University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth MedTech Center and Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce joined other major Texas cities in showing off the state to a global biotechnology market. In June, the team, called BIO Fort Worth, traveled to Toronto to exhibit at BIO 2002. BIO is considered the world‰Ûªs largest biotechnology conference, with 15,000 participants and more than 750 exhibitors.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe team did a truly great job of marketing Fort Worth and all we have to offer in way of location, collaboration and scientific workforce,‰Û said Robert Gracy, PhD, associate vice president for research and biotechnology at UNT Health Science Center, who headed the Fort Worth team‰Ûªs effort. ‰ÛÏNow, we have lots of follow-up to do.‰Û</p>
<p>BIO Fort Worth joined 21 other cities, four corporations, the Texas Healthcare and Bioscience Institute and Texas Office of Economic Development in representing the state at the Texas Pavilion in the exhibit hall. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe really went to just get a feel for the conference,‰Û said Calvin King, vice president of operations for MedTech, a business incubator for medical technology start-up businesses. ‰ÛÏWe didn‰Ûªt expect to get business for the incubator this first time around, but we came home with a good lead on a start-up company from west Texas interested in moving to Fort Worth.‰Û BIO Fort Worth members are following up with more than 150 contacts made during the three-day conference.</p>
<p>Tom Kowalski, president of THBI in Austin, was elected president of an organization representing all the states‰Ûª biotechnology programs. ‰ÛÏThis will give Texas a great deal more visibility and opportunities next year when BIO 2003 will be held in Washington, DC,‰Û Dr. Gracy said. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre already beginning to plan for next year.‰Û</p>
<p>BIO Fort Worth is working with the Health Industry Council, Dallas Life Sciences Group, the North Texas Commission, Texas Office of Economic Development, THBI and others around the state in a concerted effort to attract new biotechnology businesses to Texas, particularly north Texas. The group is also exploring ways to collaborate statewide in research, development of new products, grant opportunities and educational programs.</p>
<p>The City of Fort Worth was the lead supporter of BIO Fort Worth‰Ûªs trip to Toronto. Other sponsors included Austin Commercial, Carter-Burgess, Oncor Energy, Fort Worth Business Press, DynCorp Technical Services, AdvanceMed, GeneLink, Galderma Laboratories, UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs Office of Continuing Medical Education, Fisher Scientific, Porous Metal Products, the UNT Health Science Center Foundation, the Health Industry Council, Alcon Laboratories and Whitaker, Chalk, Swindle and Sawyer, LLP.</p>
       <p>     ‰ÛÏOur game plan was simple: develop an outstanding presentation, send the right people from Fort Worth to meet with the right people from the biotechnology industry and take full advantage of the time we have in front of this market,‰Û said Carole Myer, director of business development for the chamber. </p>
<p>    ‰ÛÏWe all benefit from bringing a new industry to Fort Worth,‰Û Myer said. ‰ÛÏOur city has some of the key pieces many of these companies are looking for, and we believe we have a good ‰Û÷product‰Ûª to make the sale.‰Û</p>
<p>    BIO Fort Worth will meet again in August to develop a follow-up plan and start preparing for BIO 2003. It is also exploring new ways for the three partner organizations to interact, with the goal of supporting research initiatives at the health science center, helping start-up companies get their discoveries to the market through the incubator and attracting existing companies to Fort Worth.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏCompanies in the biotechnology industry ‰ÛÒ from start-ups to the large, established companies ‰ÛÒ look for many things when choosing a location, among them quality transportation, low cost of doing business, diverse work force and a strong research presence,‰Û said Ronald Blanck, DO, health science center president. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe health science center and other research institutions in north Texas act as a catalyst for bringing important research to the region and set in motion a self-sustaining business cycle that benefits the entire business community,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏHigher education offers companies research space and facilities, scientific expertise with discoveries already in the making, and an educated workforce. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe companies, in turn, bring their resources, enhance development of new products invented in our research labs and partner with us in conducting research,‰Û Dr. Blanck said. ‰ÛÏJob opportunities that grow from this co-existence draw more students to the region. The continuum grows and expands.‰Û</p>
<p>To help drive Fort Worth‰Ûªs efforts forward, UNT Health Science Center will break ground this fall on a new Biotechnology Center. The center will provide education and research associated with biotechnology, including space for research institutes and a genomics and proteomics core facility. Services to support biotechnology companies and space to house MedTech‰Ûªs medically related start-ups are also planned. </p>
<p>The institution is in the preliminary stages of a capital fundraising campaign for the building project. Initial construction will be financed with $27.5 million in tuition revenue bonds approved by the Texas Legislature in 2001.</p>
<p>The predicted impact on the health science center‰Ûªs success in biotechnology, if space allows, includes significantly higher research expenditures and enrollment by the year 2010. Research funding can grow to an estimated $35 million, more than double what it is today, without adding any more faculty researchers. The additional space will also allow the institution to accept an additional 280 students.
In addition, the institution‰Ûªs Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences has implemented a biotechnology master‰Ûªs degree program designed to train individuals for careers in the industry by providing the tools and experience needed for highly technical positions offered in biotechnology companies and research institutions. </p>
<p>Students take integrated biomedical sciences courses that provide the breadth and depth needed to understand complex biomedical problems. In addition to training in molecular, cellular, physiological and pharmacological techniques, the students complete an internship in a research or industrial laboratory that forms the basis of the internship practicum. </p>
<p>In the fall, the Fort Worth MedTech Center will begin holding monthly seminars with health science center faculty to take them through the steps of getting their discoveries into the pipeline for development. Professional presenters will provide information on intellectual property law, business planning and other topics pertinent to the business side of product development.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe reason UNT Health Science Center was active in the founding of the MedTech incubator was because of the benefits we could bring to the researchers here,‰Û King said. ‰ÛÏWe need to make sure these scientists and physicians know what resources we provide, and what opportunities they have in being a part of moving discoveries from the lab to the market. We‰Ûªll see our labors bear fruit to the benefit of the local economy ‰ÛÓ even as we change the world with new cures and treatments for life-threatening illnesses.‰Û </p>

   <p>Between four to 12 percent of school-age children may have some form of ADHD, said James Hall, chair of department of health psychology at UNT Health Science Center. Symptoms include inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. ADHD is notoriously difficult to diagnose, since other conditions such as childhood depression or anxiety disorders may cause symptoms similar to ADHD, he said.</p>

<p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, there appears to be a link between a person's ability to pay continued attention and measures that reflect brain activity.  In people with ADHD, the brain areas that control attention appear to be less active, suggesting that a lower level of activity in some parts of the brain may be related to difficulties paying attention. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThanks to a new tool from Lexicor, we are able to measure the electrical patterns of a child‰Ûªs brain and have it compared to data from children who have been identified with ADHD and those who have not,‰Û Dr. Hall explained. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThis technique, called quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG), measures the brain‰Ûªs electrical activities. Studies have shown that 90% of those diagnosed with ADHD have a slower pattern of electrical activity in certain areas of the brain than those without ADHD,‰Û he said. </p>
<p>According to the American Academy of Pediatrics in ADHD: A Complete and Authoritative Guide, QEEG ‰ÛÏwill help experts more clearly document the neurological and behavioral nature of ADHD, paving the way for better understanding and treatment of ADHD.‰Û</p>
          <p>‰ÛÏThis is another, more physical assessment to help us in the evaluation of ADHD. It is combined with observation of the child‰Ûªs behavior, development of a complete developmental history and a medical examination,‰Û Dr. Hall explained.</p>
          <p>  Once the data is collected using a sensor-filled cap that fits over the child‰Ûªs head like a swimming cap, the information is sent for analysis and a DataLex‰ã¢ ADHD Indicator Report.  This report offers the physician an objective analysis of ADHD and provides clear information for both physician and parent. </p> 
<p>The non-invasive procedure takes about an hour to complete.  Please call UNT Health Science Center at 817.735.2334 to schedule an appointment to discuss whether this new technology would be appropriate for you or your child.  </p>

<p>Opal was abducted March 26, 1999, while playing with two other children near her grandmother's home in Saginaw. Horseback riders spotted remains in a rural area of northwest Fort Worth Dec. 30, 2003, and a search of the area ensued.</p>
<p>Soon after the remains were found, the Tarrant County Medical Examiner‰Ûªs Office submitted a small bone fragment to UNTHSC‰Ûªs DNA Identity Laboratory.  The lab collected a family reference sample from Opal‰Ûªs mother, Leola Sanderford, for inclusion in the Texas Missing Persons DNA Database. Due to the condition of the bone fragment, the lab was initially able to obtain only a mitochondrial DNA profile. The mitochondrial type from the bone fragment matched that of Leola Sanderford, Opal‰Ûªs mother. The DNA testing at this point demonstrated a likely maternal relationship between the reference sample from Leola and the remains.  </p>
<p>After consulting with the Chief Medical Examiner, Nizam Peerwani, MD, the lab was provided with a tooth for further DNA analysis. The DNA obtained from the tooth yielded conclusive DNA evidence indicating with a 99.99% probability that the remains were those of Opal Jennings. Dr. Peerwani officially identified the remains as those of Opal Jan. 12. </p>
<p>The state legislature established the Texas Missing Persons DNA Database in 2001 on the UNT Health Science Center campus with funding provided by the Attorney General‰Ûªs Crime Victims‰Ûª Compensation Fund. The database began accepting samples from Texas law enforcement agencies in March of 2003.  </p>
<p>‰ÛÏBecause of the expertise and resources we have here at the health science center, we were able to provide Dr. Peerwani with conclusive results significantly sooner than he had originally anticipated, thus providing the family with the knowledge that Opal has been finally found,‰Û said Arthur Eisenberg, PhD, director of the DNA Identity Lab. </p>
<p>Texas is the only state to operate its own Missing Persons DNA Database as an additional tool for investigators trying to locate missing persons or identify remains. The project compares DNA samples from family members of missing persons with samples from unidentified bodies, at no charge to law enforcement agencies or the families. </p>
<p>The health science center‰Ûªs DNA Identity Lab has provided scientific and technical support for Texas law enforcement agencies and crime labs for more than 10 years, including paternity testing, forensic genetic screening and DNA testing. The lab is one of only a handful of facilities that are able to conduct mitochondrial forensic DNA analysis and the only state laboratory that can submit mitochondrial DNA profiles directly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. </p>

<p>This is the third time UNT Health Science Center has been awarded the competitive contract. Since 1993, the academic medical center has provided medical, dental, and mental health care services to FMC-FW. </p>
""Our partnership with the federal government has been a good one, and we look forward to continuing to provide excellent service to the inmates at the Fort Worth facility,‰Û said Marc B. Hahn, DO, dean of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine at the health science center.
<p>The prison employs a variety of health care professionals, including physicians, nurses, physician assistants, dentists, and pharmacists, to provide medical, dental, and mental health care to its inmates. FMC Fort Worth provides chronic care and skilled nursing services for male Federal inmates designated to the facility.  </p>
<p>Specialty services, both inpatient and outpatient, are provided through UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs contract with FMC Fort Worth. UNT Health Science Center also provides on-site specialty clinics at FMC Fort Worth, including a variety of surgical and internal medicine specialties.  </p>  
<p>Rep. Kay Granger, who represents Fort Worth, lauded the contract being awarded again to the health science center. ""Keeping contracts within our community is so important for our local economy,"" she said. ""The contract between FMC and UNT Health Science Center saves taxpayer dollars and keeps skilled professionals in our area.""</p>
<p>Federal Medical Center-Fort Worth is one of seven medical referral center facilities in the United States operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  FMC Fort Worth currently houses 1,500 male inmates.  More than half of the prison's population was sent to FMC Fort Worth for chronic or specialty health care. </p>

<p>Weathered faces of drifters captured by photographer Richard Avedon. The John Singer Sargent portrait of heiress Alice Vanderbilt Shepard. These and other works of art are the centerpiece of a new partnership between UNT Health Science Center and the Amon Carter Museum.</p>
<p>Last March, the two Fort Worth institutions launched ‰ÛÏAn Eye for Detail: The Art of Observation,‰Û a workshop where medical students developed their diagnostic skills by examining paintings and photographs from the museum‰Ûªs collection. A second workshop was held in November.</p>
<p>The inaugural group of seven medical students participated in the free, six-hour extracurricular class, held on three Thursday evenings in March and April.</p>
<p>During each session, students looked closely at portraits in the galleries and shared their observations about the subject, including age, ethnicity, mood, occupation and other visual cues. Then they applied those same skills to medical photographs. A team of trained gallery teachers, a museum educator and medical school faculty facilitated the class. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏObservation skills are absolutely critical for successful treatment but are hard to teach,‰Û said Bernard Rubin, DO, MPH, professor of internal medicine. ‰ÛÏFuture physicians have to learn to trust their judgment and use technology or medical charts to supplement it, not replace it.‰Û</p>
<p>‰ÛÏBy looking closely at selected portraits in the museum‰Ûªs collection, medical students can describe, share and back up what they see with visual clues,‰Û said Laura Matzer, public programs coordinator at the Amon Carter Museum. ‰ÛÏOur goal is that these future physicians will then apply those same critical observational skills in working with actual patients, and not go right for their charts.‰Û</p>
<p>The workshop is modeled after similar classes at Yale, Weill-Cornell, and the University of Texas at Houston. </p>
<p>Located across the street from each other, the health science center and the museum have long been neighbors in the museum district of Fort Worth.</p>
<p>The Carter opened in 1961 through the generosity of Amon G. Carter Sr. to house his collection of approximately 400 paintings and sculptures by Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell. 
The collection has since grown to almost 250,000 works of American art, including masterpieces in painting, sculpture, photography and works on paper by leading artists of the 19th and 20th centuries. The photography collection alone is one of the largest and most significant in the country.</p>

<p>When UNT Health Science Center officials and the board members of Dallas Southwest Osteopathic Physicians Inc. began searching for someone to hold the newly endowed DSWOP chair of clinical geriatrics, they soon realized that the best candidate was one of the country‰Ûªs leading geriatricians, who just happened to be a professor at the health science center.</p>
<p>Janice Knebl, DO, MBA, professor of internal medicine and chief of geriatrics, has been selected to be the Dallas Southwest Osteopathic Physicians Inc. distinguished chair of clinical geriatrics. </p>
<p> ‰ÛÏDr. Knebl is recognized as one of the country‰Ûªs leading geriatricians,‰Û said Marc Hahn, DO, dean of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine. ‰ÛÏThe program she has built here over the past 15 years now boasts an international reputation for excellence and was ranked as one of the top fellowship programs in the country by U.S. News & World Report.‰Û</p>
<p>Joseph LaManna, Sr., DO, DSWOP chair, said, ‰ÛÏWe think she is absolutely the best choice for the position. We have long been impressed with her work at the health science center, and we know that our support will enable her to accomplish even more in the future.‰Û</p>
<p>The endowment was created in 2001 when DSWOP pledged $1.2 million, the largest gift in its history, to the health science center. The position holds special significance because it is the first chair in clinical geriatrics at any osteopathic medical school.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe majority of patients seen in clinics and hospitals will soon be older than 65,‰Û Dr. LaManna said. ‰ÛÏThe need for clinicians trained in geriatric care will only grow.‰Û</p>
<p>The endowment is intended to serve as a permanent catalyst for expanded clinical geriatric services to older adults and their caregivers in north Texas. In addition, it allows the health science center to provide expert training and mentoring in geriatrics for medical students, residents and geriatric fellows, Dr. Hahn said. </p>
<p>Caring for seniors comes naturally to Dr. Knebl. She said she has always been comfortable around older people. ‰ÛÏI come from a traditional extended family that‰Ûªs extremely close-knit. My grandparents were very involved in raising me, and I always spent time around relatives from several generations.‰Û</p>
<p>She also spent a summer working at a Jersey shore hotel with a largely senior clientele. ‰ÛÏI was surrounded by seniors and enjoyed getting to know them.‰Û</p>
<p>She said she also began to appreciate the unique knowledge that seniors could share with her. ‰ÛÏI realized that seniors are walking, talking history books. If you just listen to them, you‰Ûªll learn a lot ‰ÛÒ about the world, about them and about yourself.‰Û </p>
<p>Later in medical school at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Dr. Knebl chose to turn this appreciation for seniors into an avocation and make geriatric care her specialty. ‰ÛÏEveryone thought I was certifiable for choosing such an unpopular specialty.‰Û</p>
<p>At that time, geriatric care was a relatively new field. Specialized fellowships had been established only a few years earlier, and training opportunities were scarce.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏI had no role models. I never worked with a trained geriatrician. No one devoted their career to geriatrics,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏThat‰Ûªs all changed.‰Û</p>
<p>Today, more than 50 fellowships in geriatrics exist across the country, and every medical school requires some geriatric training, she said.</p>
<p>The health science center, one of the first institutions to offer specialized medical training in geriatric care and to conduct research into aging issues, has long been a pioneer in addressing health issues for seniors.
In 1994, it established the first geriatric fellowship program in the Dallas-Fort Worth area so that physicians and dentists could receive advanced training in caring for elderly patients. Recently, the program was expanded to include psychologists.</p>
<p>Dr. Knebl said she has a vision for how to use the endowment to upgrade the school‰Ûªs work in geriatrics.
‰ÛÏDSWOP‰Ûªs generosity enables us to expand our training opportunities and further develop our clinical research program,‰Û she said. </p>
<p>Dr. Knebl has set her sights on establishing a required rotation in geriatric medicine for fourth-year medical students. Geriatrics is now one of several elective rotations students choose from as they train in internal medicine.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏEvery student would have interdisciplinary exposure to geriatric care. They would have training in geriatrics from staff trained in the specialty,‰Û she said. </p>
<p>The health science center has one of the few geriatric clinics where physicians, nurse practitioners, psychologists, social workers and other clinical staff have been specially trained to deal with the issues faced by aging patients, she said. ‰ÛÏStudents become part of a team approach to caring for our patients and develop an appreciation for other health professionals.‰Û</p>
<p>She would like for students to be more exposed to seniors throughout their years in medical school. ‰ÛÏA lot of your career choices are affected by what you‰Ûªre exposed to. With the decrease in extended families, young people may spend less time around older generations and not realize the issues seniors face.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Knebl would also like to use the endowment to expand applied clinical research in geriatrics. The clinic staff already participates in clinical trials to evaluate new therapies for chronic illnesses, especially Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease and other causes of dementia, but she said research is an often-overlooked area that can dramatically improve patients‰Ûª lives.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏNew therapies can make such a difference in older patients,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏWe try to help them maintain their level of function for as long as possible so they can remain independent.‰Û</p>
<p>The endowment is one of many ways DSWOP has demonstrated its support of the health science center. Previous gifts totaling $1.2 million have supported loans and scholarships to medical students and funded the Professional and Continuing Education office. </p>
 <p>‰ÛÏDSWOP continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to UNT Health Science Center,‰Û Dr. LaManna said. ‰ÛÏWith this gift, we‰Ûªve more than doubled the amount of support we‰Ûªve provided to the health science center over the years.‰Û</p>
<p>DSWOP, a non-profit organization, was established with proceeds from the 1983 sale of Stevens Park Osteopathic Hospital. It has since distributed more than $13 million in grants to more than 150 organizations.</p>

<p>For the past decade, the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine has led the state in producing the highest percentage of graduates who enter family practice residencies. </p>
<p>The Texas Academy of Family Physicians honors medical schools that have at least 25 percent of the graduating class enter a family practice residency program with its Medical School Award of Achievement. 
The health science center has received the award for 10 consecutive years and has been the sole recipient five times, including this year.</p>
<p>This year, 29 percent of TCOM graduates entered a family practice residency program.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏMost of the physicians in rural communities are approaching or are past retirement age. The increased need for family physicians is more critical in these areas because family physicians provide the full spectrum of patient care, from delivering babies to caring for children, adults and elders, in both the hospital and physician‰Ûªs office,‰Û said Elizabeth Palmarozzi, DO, acting chair of family medicine.  </p>
<p>‰ÛÏAs dean, I am proud of our osteopathic heritage and the historical foundations for which this school was established, as well as the impact we have on primary care in the state of Texas,‰Û said Marc Hahn, DO, TCOM dean. ‰ÛÏOur challenge remains to continue to fulfill this critical need for the citizens of Texas.‰Û</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,216,11/1/03 0:00,HSC RESEARCH FUNDING GROWS TO NEW RECORD,"
<p> 
UNT Health Science Center now boasts a record nearly $17 million in annual research funding, up from $14 million last year. </p>
<p>The health science center also has a high ratio of turning its state appropriated research dollars into federal funding. Last year, for every $1 in state research dollars, the institution brought in $15.08 in federal funding, according to a report by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. This compares with a federal to state funding ratio of only $4.23 for the other health-related institutions in the state.</p>
<p>The growth comes from increased research in every school, said Robert Gracy, PhD, associate vice president of research and biotechnology.</p>
<p>The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences continues to conduct a majority of the research on campus and generate much of the funding for research efforts, he said.</p>
<p>The Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine is reporting increases in the amount of its research funding as well, mostly attributable to its clinical trials contracts with pharmaceutical companies, Dr. Gracy said.
The School of Public Health also made a substantial increase in its research funding with several projects funded in the past two years, he said.</p>
<p>Much of the institution‰Ûªs research growth comes from increased funding available from the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Gracy said. Approximately 60 percent of the health science center‰Ûªs research funding comes from the NIH.</p>
<p>A growing percentage of the total research funding comes from sponsored research agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, Dr. Gracy said. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs important to understand that the institution earns money in different ways from sponsored research,‰Û he said.
The most direct way is from the sponsored research agreement itself. ‰ÛÏThe SRA provides immediate revenue to the institution by paying for salaries, equipment and supplies.‰Û The sponsor may also provide funding for patent expenses and legal fees. </p>
<p>Another source of income from sponsored research may come from equity in the company itself. ‰ÛÏA company may offer us shares so that we are truly partners sharing, both the potential profits and any financial risks involved,‰Û Dr. Gracy said.</p>
<p>The institution may also license technology for a percentage of the company‰Ûªs profits. ‰ÛÏThis royalty income comes far in the future, especially with biotechnology research since they have to go through the long and expensive process of clinical trials and FDA approval,‰Û Dr. Gracy said.</p>
<p>Some corporate research sponsors want only additional professionals to work on specific projects, he said. ‰ÛÏIn those scenarios, they consider us ‰Û÷work-for-hire,‰Ûª and the institution usually does not have any rights to the intellectual property of the research.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Gracy said he sees a bright future ahead for research at the health science center. ‰ÛÏOver the next several years, our research funding is sure to continue to increase. Our grant submissions are up, and feedback on the quality of our work is outstanding.‰Û</p>
<p>###</p>",,,,,215,11/1/03 0:00,HSC ANNIVERSARY MARKS DECADE OF GROWTH,"<p>The vision of the young medical school in Fort Worth maturing into a health science center started long before the summer of 1993. But it was during that busy summer 10 years ago that the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine officially became a part of the newly established University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.</p>
<p>That summer bore witness to the culmination of years of planning and preparation. During its 1993 session, the Texas Legislature redesignated TCOM as UNT Health Science Center, and Governor Ann Richards signed the bill into law. The institution had to add an additional component to qualify as a health science center, and the establishment of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in late August made it official. TCOM became the cornerstone of the new institution. </p>
<p>The new designation signaled the start of a new and exciting era for the institution and broadened the range of options for developing new programs.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThis is a significant and exciting time in TCOM‰Ûªs history,‰Û said then President David Richards, DO. ‰ÛÏTCOM is developing into a health science center at a time when the challenges facing our country‰Ûªs health care system have never been greater.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Richards was one of several TCOM leaders who shared the vision for a health science center. </p>
<p>Carl Everett, DO, one of TCOM‰Ûªs founders, said, ‰ÛÏI would never have dreamed that we would make this much progress in a little more than 20 years. This is such a major step in TCOM‰Ûªs development.‰Û
The late George Luibel, DO, a fellow founder, shared that sentiment. ‰ÛÏThe designation will help TCOM receive additional recognition throughout the country.‰Û</p>
<p> Bobby Carter, MLS, assistant vice president for information resources and a 25-year employee, remembers how former president Ralph Willard, DO, encouraged him to expand the library from one with only a clinical collection to one with a research mission. 
‰ÛÏThe library had to expand its services and develop a collection to meet the growing needs of a new type of institution,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>The most significant change to the institution was the addition of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.
The new graduate school was formed as the result of a formal transfer of the Department of Biomedical Sciences from the University of North Texas in Denton. UNT and TCOM faculty had collaborated since the early 1970s to teach basic science courses to medical students and train students earning master‰Ûªs or doctoral degrees in biomedical sciences, biology or biochemistry. </p>
<p>By 1992, the TCOM faculty was training more than 70 graduate and doctoral students. These students received nearly all their training at the Fort Worth campus from TCOM faculty while officially earning their degrees from UNT.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏWhen the graduate school was being created, we had to convince UNT to transfer some of its science programs to our institution and allow us to incorporate them into our biomedical sciences programs,‰Û said Thomas Yorio, PhD, GSBS dean. Dr. Yorio joined the TCOM faculty in 1977 and was selected to lead the new graduate school in 1993.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe believed that to continue to grow as an institution, it was important to become a health science center and to add new programs that the community and state needed,‰Û Dr. Yorio said.</p>
<p>The Association of Academic Health Centers defines a health science center as an educational institution with a university medical school and at least one other health education program. ‰ÛÏHealth science centers are sometimes called ‰Û÷medical school plus‰Ûª since they are required by definition to offer more than medical degrees,‰Û said Ronald Blanck, DO, health science center president.</p>
<p>TCOM‰Ûªs transformation into a health science center mirrored national trends in medical education at the time. By the 1990s, medical education had become dominated by academic medical centers; more than 80 percent of medical schools were linked to such institutions in 1993. As a result of these changes, many of the remaining stand-alone medical schools went through the same process TCOM did, said Greg McQueen, PhD, senior vice president for academic and health affairs. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe organizational structure of 
a health science center became a prerequisite to accomplishing our mission of education, research and patient care,‰Û Dr. McQueen said.
TCOM could better ensure its long-term viability as a health science center because stand-alone medical schools faced significant challenges competing with health science centers for research and training grants, faculty, and students, he explained. </p>
<p>All of the health science centers in Texas and most of the ones in the United States are now closely tied to a university, which adds to the resources and prestige of both types of institutions.</p>
<p>Being redesignated as a health science center was much more than a simple name change; it expanded the mission of the institution and laid the groundwork for today‰Ûªs accomplishments, Dr. McQueen said.
In 1993, Dr. Richards described the designation as an evolution. ‰ÛÏBecoming a health science center sets the stage for us to move forward,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>When compared with stand-alone counterparts, health science centers can propel the medical school and each of their other components to new levels of quality in carrying out their mission by combining the resources of several health professions to address the complex health issues facing today‰Ûªs society, Dr. Blanck said.
‰ÛÏBeing a health science center promotes growth among all programs,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏIt creates a synergy that uses what each program offers and leverages it to become a greater whole.‰Û</p>
<p>Becoming a full health science center marked the beginning of a period of unprecedented growth, which included the addition of the School of Public Health and the Physician Assistant Studies Program. 
Enrollment has doubled to more than 1,000 students, and annual research funding has nearly tripled; it now totals nearly $17 million, up from $6 million in 1993.</p>
<p>In fact, the health science center leads all health-related institutions in Texas in enrollment growth, according to recent statistics from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Overall, the institution boasted 38 percent growth from 2001 to 2003, while the statewide average was 10 percent.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe highest percentage of growth came from the programs formed since we became a health science center,‰Û Dr. McQueen said. </p>
<p>As the health science center enters its second decade, it is poised to continue this upward trend, with record enrollment, ever-increasing research funding and nationally recognized programs, Dr. Blanck said.
‰ÛÏOur programs are set to grow in different ways,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏExisting programs will expand, new programs will be developed, and the success of one area fosters new achievements in another.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏBeing a health science center allows us to tap into the full spectrum of health-related activities,‰Û Dr. Blanck said. ‰ÛÏEverything we do fits together and is linked to our core competencies. Our challenge is to focus on our strengths and maintain a tight focus on our mission.‰Û</p>

<<p>i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n</i>, or Health for Your Heart, has impacted the lives and health of almost 200 local Hispanic families since it began in 2001. The program, implemented locally by the School of Public Health at UNT Health Science Center, trains lay health educators, or promotores, to bring heart-healthy messages to their communities.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏMany Hispanics are unaware of preventive measures to reduce the risk of heart disease, and cultural factors such as language barriers predispose Latinos not to have access to public health messages and health education,‰Û said principal investigator Hector Balcazar, PhD, chair and professor of social and behavioral sciences in the School of Public Health. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThis is especially problematic because cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Latinos, and they have a disproportionate distribution of many of the risk factors for heart disease,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>Preliminary results from the first group of families completing the program indicate that the promotores have had a positive impact on the families they counseled and have been successfully communicating their message, said project co-director Mary Luna Hollen, PhD, RD, LD. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe families made healthier lifestyle choices and better understood the health effects of factors such as salt and sodium intake, cholesterol and fat, and weight control. The mothers also became more physically active, which may influence other family members to exercise more,‰Û she said. </p>
<p>The <i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n </i>team consists of 19 promotores, 29 network partner organizations and 10 public health students from the health science center. Participating families were divided into two groups and given a ‰ÛÏpre-test‰Û to determine their behaviors and practices regarding various health-related subjects, she said.
The first group took part in six comprehensive family sessions on healthy lifestyle behaviors presented in Spanish by the promotores, who followed the families for six months, Dr. Hollen said.</p>
<p>Those families also received culturally sensitive health education on cardiovascular risk factors, physical activity, blood pressure and sodium, cholesterol and fat, healthy weight, and diet. Salud para su CorazÌ_n participants in this group have shown an increased understanding about how to lead healthier lifestyles, based on their responses to a ‰ÛÏpost-test‰Û given after they completed the program, Dr. Hollen said.</p>
<p>The second group of families is a comparison group designed to determine the effect of the promotora. ‰ÛÏWe are determining if meeting with a promotora is more effective than traditional classroom settings or written material,‰Û she said. The families in the second group receive monthly educational materials by mail, a monthly telephone call and a post card every two to three months, but are not attending the promotora family sessions. Results from this group are expected to be analyzed later this year.</p>
<p>In August, a third group of 20-25 families were studied for three months to gather more information about the effects of meeting with a promotora. The participants included people already on medication for heart disease, diabetes or high blood pressure. They participated in the six-lesson family session conducted by the promotores, who will target their sessions to address the families‰Ûª risk factors and health conditions, Dr. Hollen said. </p>
<p>The families in this clinical sample will be followed for a three-month period, and will also receive information by mail and phone calls from the promotora. Health science center researchers will assess the effect of the program by comparing the families‰Ûª answers on a test before starting the program to their answers after completing it. 
‰ÛÏThe program has been very well received by the community. Families become very connected with the promotora and many family participants want to become a promotora themselves,‰Û said Dr. Hollen. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe <i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n</i> program was tailor-made to meet the needs of Latino families,‰Û Dr. Balcazar said. ‰ÛÏThe promotores believe that our communities are like flowers, and we are to care for them and water them with ‰Û÷droplets‰Ûª of health information. It‰Ûªs a team effort where all voices are heard and all ideas are used.‰Û</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe promotores are so dedicated to the program they will keep meeting with each other and with families on a volunteer basis after the formal program ends in January,‰Û Dr. Hollen said. ‰ÛÏA network of promotores and partner organizations is forming to pursue future support and funding of the program. Many of the network partners will also continue to provide supplies, meeting facilities and other support.‰Û Partners include hospitals, churches, community nonprofit organizations and many others. </p>
<p>The School of Public Health team is developing a model, complete with a multi-media CD-ROM, to show others how they implemented Salud para su CorazÌ_n and why the program is important. Planning, promotora training and evaluation will be among the topics discussed. They presented their recommendations in June at the national conference of the Society of Public Health Educators in New Mexico.</p>
<p><i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n</i> was created by the National Institutes of Health‰Ûªs National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in 1994 as a pilot project in Washington, DC. It now serves communities in Texas, Illinois, New Mexico and California. The School of Public Health was one of six organizations across the country selected to form the foundation of a national effort to educate people in low-income and minority communities about cardiovascular disease. The health science center received $429,000 over three years from the NHLBI to implement the program.</p>

 <p>UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs research has increasingly been focusing on developing its translational research efforts, those that extend basic discoveries into useful products.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThis is often called moving a product from the bench to the bedside,‰Û said Robert Gracy, PhD, associate vice president for research and biotechnology. ‰ÛÏWe want to take research findings and translate them into new drugs, treatments and diagnostics.‰Û </p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve done very well in a relatively short period of time,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>The health science center added a division of technology transfer to the Office of Research and Biotechnology in 1999 with the goal of helping faculty through the process of developing their research into marketable products.
The tech transfer effort mirrored a national trend in which academic institutions and faculty began realizing that their research had economic potential. </p>
<p>Before biotechnology became a booming business in the 1990s, most academic researchers only thought of their work as an addition to the overall body of scientific knowledge. ‰ÛÏScientists would publish their findings without first protecting them, with the expectation that their research would enter the public domain and be available to anyone and everyone,‰Û Dr. Gracy said.</p>
<p>But instead of companies seeing the potential in the research and developing it further, most saw only the financial risk of basing their product on unprotected intellectual property, he said. Often, that meant that potentially useful discoveries remained undeveloped.</p>
<p>Companies prefer to develop their own proprietary research in-house or work with partners on research that has been protected, he said. ‰ÛÏThat way, they know that they are developing a product that can be competitive and are more likely to choose to pay the high costs involved in developing it to a marketable drug or medical device.‰Û</p>
<p>By establishing a tech transfer office, the health science center helped pave the way to move research conducted on campus into the translational arena. </p>
<p>The office has developed policies and procedures to expedite patents and intellectual property. The staff also guide researchers through the process of protecting and marketing their work and help identify potential corporate partners. </p>
<p>With the addition of a technology transfer office, a paradigm shift began to occur, Dr. Gracy said. ‰ÛÏFaculty began thinking about the economic value of practical extensions of their discoveries, rather than only considering its value as an academic pursuit,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>The tech transfer office conducts due diligence on potential partners and ensures that contracts build in protections for the researcher and the institution. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs not all about making money; sometimes it‰Ûªs about protecting the work and not losing money,‰Û Dr. Gracy said.</p>
<p>The office evaluates its success in four key technology transfer areas: invention disclosures, patent applications filed, licenses executed and start-up companies formed, Dr. Gracy said.</p>
<p>During the past three years, the institution had 31 inventions disclosed by researchers, filed for 27 patents, executed 10 licensing agreements and formed 3 start-up companies, according to annual figures reported by the technology transfer office.
‰ÛÏIf you compare total dollars, then obviously we can‰Ûªt compare with the University of California with its more than $2 billion in research,‰Û Dr. Gracy said. ‰ÛÏHowever, we have become very efficient and effective in translating our research.‰Û </p>
<p>When these outcomes are calculated per research dollar awarded, the health science center‰Ûªs productivity becomes apparent, he said.
‰ÛÏOur success with maximizing our research dollars ranks us among the top institutions in the country,‰Û he said.
Recently, the health science center underwent three separate reviews of its tech transfer activities. The staff surveyed its clients and partners, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board reviewed all health-related institutions, and an outside consultant evaluated the office for its effectiveness. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏAll three reviews gave us very high scores and came to the same conclusions ‰ÛÓ we are very effective with the resources we have and could do more with additional resources,‰Û Dr. Gracy said.</p>
<p>A specific problem area revealed by the reviews is the lack of funds to pay legal and patent fees to protect new intellectual property with potential, he said. The office is now working to address this issue by establishing a source of funds that can be used to help projects through the intellectual property process.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏMost academic institutions face this same bottleneck,‰Û Dr. Gracy said. ‰ÛÏSome of the established and successful universities use royalty income from established successful projects to fund newer projects that are just starting the process. We‰Ûªre not there yet.‰Û</p>
<p>The office has added some services to help researchers protect their work, including helping them file for provisional patents that protect their work for one year. ‰ÛÏThat gives us some time to locate potential partners who are able to provide the resources to continue the process,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>The health science center is well on its way to becoming a recognized player in the biotechnology field and moving discoveries through the intellectual property ‰ÛÏpipeline‰Û from the laboratory to the marketplace, he said.
 ‰ÛÏYou can put projects into the pipeline, but they need to go all the way through the process and reach the public to make it all truly worthwhile,‰Û Dr. Gracy said.</p>
<p>The technology transfer office has become an active partner with Tech Fort Worth, a local business incubator that helps start-up companies take discoveries into the marketplace. ‰ÛÏWe also work with investors, venture capital companies and corporate partners to identify opportunities for them to support research on our campus and move intellectual property through the pipeline,‰Û he said. </p>
<p>###</p>",,,,,212,11/1/03 0:00,NIA FUNDS HSC BRAIN AGING RESEARCH,"<p>The Institute for Aging and Alzheimer‰Ûªs Disease Research and the Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience will receive $8.6 million over a five-year period from the National Institute on Aging to study several mechanisms that influence brain aging.  </p>

<p>‰ÛÏWe are nationally recognized for quality science,‰Û said James Simpkins, PhD, director of the Institute for Aging and Alzheimer‰Ûªs Disease Research and chair of pharmacology and neuroscience. ‰ÛÏThis confirms the excellence of our scientists and their research.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe grant will investigate the causes and consequences of normal brain aging,‰Û Dr. Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏWe hope that by better understanding how the brain ages normally, we can pinpoint what happens when there are problems and develop therapies to address conditions like Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏTo receive a program project grant from the National Institutes of Health, of which the NIA is a part, individual research projects must be part of a program that is connected both theoretically and practically,‰Û Dr. Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏEach of these projects will be better because they are part of this interdependent group,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏThe discoveries made on each project will influence how the other investigations develop.‰Û</p>
<p>The research team includes Michael Forster, PhD, professor; Peter Koulen, PhD, assistant professor; Glenn Dillon, PhD, associate professor; Meharvan Singh, PhD, assistant professor; James Simpkins, PhD, professor and chair; Christopher de Fiebre, PhD, assistant professor, all of pharmacology and neuroscience, and Karan Singh, PhD, chair and professor of biostatistics. The project began Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Dr. Forster is interested in how brain oxidation relates to cognitive decline, coordination and motor skills, both in normal brain aging and in cases of Alzheimer‰Ûªs and Parkinson‰Ûªs disease. In all of the body‰Ûªs cells, the cellular machinery that makes energy produces reactive oxygen molecules called free radicals as a byproduct, he said. The free radicals are unstable and tend to react with other molecules, which is often dangerous to the machinery of other cells, Dr. Forster explained. Because cells are constantly generating energy and therefore producing some level of free radicals, the cells are constantly under attack, or exposed to oxidative stress, since they are always trying to fight off the damaging free radical molecules. </p>
<p>During the aging process, the battle is progressively lost, so the cells keep getting more and more damaged, Dr. Forster said. Brain cells do not typically replicate, so they cannot replace themselves, and over time, their function is disrupted. Once the cells begin to become damaged, they produce more free radicals, creating more damage and becoming trapped in this vicious cycle. Dr. Forster is investigating whether oxidative stress is a cause of Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease and other milder age-related changes in the brain. ‰ÛÏIf we understand how oxidative stress causes normal brain aging, we would have a lot of insight into how it is involved in Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Koulen is studying a specific set of proteins inside nerve cells that are critical to the cells‰Ûª functions and influence the properties of nerve cells affected with Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease and age-related cognitive impairment. These proteins are responsible for controlling the release of calcium from stores inside a cell into the cell, which is important because small changes in calcium concentration and the shape and size of these changes are used by nerve cells to mediate important processes in the brain. Dr. Koulen said his team‰Ûªs goal is to determine where, how and when such changes occur in established model systems for Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease and age-related cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>Drs. Meharvan Singh and Dillon are working together to study how progesterone relates to brain aging and understand how it communicates with the inside of the cell. Dr. Dillon is concentrating on channels called GABAA receptors that let chloride into the cell. When the GABAA receptor is activated, it causes the inhibition, or slowing down, of that cell‰Ûªs activity. They theorize that long-term inhibition may underlie the nerve dysfunction that takes place in age-related diseases, Dr. Singh said. They believe that progesterone may help alleviate the slowing down of the nerve cells by inhibiting the GABAA receptor so that it stops letting chloride into the cells. </p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Singh is studying the involvement of specific sequences of biochemical events called signal transduction pathways and the regulation of certain proteins called neurotrophins that may help protect the nerve cell from age-related brain dysfunction. He said they hope that by better understanding the biology of aging, they may be able to develop treatments for the prevention of age-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Dr. Simpkins is studying the normal role of estrogens in brain structure and function during aging. His research addresses the impact of estrogen loss at menopause on cognitive decline, nerve cell loss and the changes in the brain that occur in Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease. This research is built on a foundation of evidence that estrogens serve to protect the brain from many age-related conditions. Further, in collaboration with Dr. Meharvan Singh, he will determine the effects of combined therapy with estrogens and progesterones on age-related changes in brain function.</p>
<p>Dr. de Fiebre will analyze learning ability, or cognition, and psychomotor skills using laboratory models. He is interested in how these brain functions decline with aging in some individuals, but not in others. Dr. de Fiebre said he hopes to find out why some individuals demonstrate brain aging while others do not. ‰ÛÏBy identifying the biochemical basis of brain aging, drugs or other treatments might be able to be developed to slow or reverse this debilitating and costly problem,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Karan Singh and other biostatisticians from the School of Public Health will provide centralized statistical services and collaborative research support to the program projects and monitor the quality of experimental designs and statistical analyses. They will provide statistical expertise for the design, data management and analysis for the research projects.  </p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe will be responsible for taking the enormous amounts of data the program project grant will generate and analyzing it to determine how the research findings are most significantly related to brain aging,‰Û he said. </p>

<p>These enlargements, called abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), can rupture if left untreated, causing internal bleeding and requiring emergency surgery. AAAs are the 13th leading cause of death in the United States and one of the leading causes of sudden death in men over age 65, said Burke Delange, DO, assistant professor of surgery and lead endovascular surgeon. </p>
<p>However, if AAAs are detected early and surgically repaired, the risk of a rupture can be eliminated 95 percent of the time, according to the East Carolina University School of Medicine. </p>
<p>The traditional method of repairing these aneurysms requires surgeons to open a patient‰Ûªs abdomen or chest with a large incision and move the organs aside to reach the aorta, Dr. Delange said. 
‰ÛÏThe traditional method is major, invasive surgery with a long recovery time,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏTypically, patients undergoing the standard therapy will spend five to seven days in the hospital, including time in the intensive care unit. It will then take about six to eight weeks for patients to fully recover.‰Û </p>
<p>‰ÛÏHowever, when an aneurysm is repaired using endovascular surgery, two small incisions are made in the upper thigh instead of the large abdominal incision,‰Û Dr. Delange explained. ‰ÛÏWe use a catheter to move a graft, or tube, through the bloodstream to the location of the artery. Once it‰Ûªs in place, tiny hooks on the graft are used to fasten it in place so it reinforces the part of the artery where the aneurysm has occurred.‰Û </p>
<p>When an aneurysm is repaired using endovascular surgery, patients spend only two days in the hospital and do not need to go to ICU, Dr. Delange said. They usually recover fully in one to two weeks, and some will return to their normal activities even sooner.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe want to let patients know that they have options. There is a less invasive alternative to the traditional treatment,‰Û Dr. Delange said. ‰ÛÏWhile endovascular surgery may not be right for everyone, patients should certainly explore all their options.‰Û</p>

<p>The Coordinating Board compiles full-time equivalent (FTE) student enrollment figures from the various institutions and provides them to the legislature each biennium to use in setting the Instructions and Operations funding for the schools, which is based on enrollment figures. The base periods for the comparison were for the budgets for fiscal years 2002-2003 and 2004-2005.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve been setting enrollment records each semester for some time now, but we weren‰Ûªt aware that we were growing faster than everyone else,‰Û said Ronald Blanck, DO, UNTHSC president. ‰ÛÏMost of our growth comes from those programs formed since we became a comprehensive health science center in 1993.‰Û</p>
<p>UNTHSC is completing a six-story building on its campus for the growing number of students enrolled in its biomedical sciences and public health graduate programs. It‰Ûªs using state  and federal funding, combined with private gifts from foundations, corporations and individuals to complete the new Center for Biotechnology and Public Health by May.</p>
<p>In the past two years, total enrollment at UNTHSC grew 36 percent, from 744 FTE students to 1,014 FTE students. The average growth for all health-related institutions was 11 percent. </p>
<p>UNTHSC‰Ûªs medical school grew five percent in its enrollment in that time frame. The average for state medical schools was one percent growth.</p>

Distinguished Chair of Clinical Geriatrics at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth. </p>
<p>Dr. Knebl currently serves as a professor of internal medicine and chief of geriatrics at the Fort Worth medical school.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏDr. Knebl is recognized as one of the country‰Ûªs leading geriatricians,‰Û said Marc Hahn, DO, dean of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine. ‰ÛÏThe program she has built here over the past 15 years now boasts an international reputation for excellence and was ranked as one of the top fellowship programs in the country by <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>.‰Û</p>
<p>In 2001, DSWOP pledged $1.2 million, the largest gift in its history, to the health science center to create the endowment. The position holds special significance as the first chair in clinical geriatrics among all osteopathic medical schools.</p>
<p>The endowment builds upon UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs long-term commitment to addressing health issues that affect an aging population. It was one of the first institutions in the country to offer specialized medical training in geriatric care to doctors, dentists, and psychologists. Through its outpatient-based Geriatric Assessment and Planning Program, the only one in the Metroplex, a team of physicians, psychologists, social workers, and geriatric nurse specialists work with older patients to thoroughly examine and assess their needs. Scientists in UNTHSC‰Ûªs Institute for Aging and Alzheimer‰Ûªs Disease Research are making discoveries that could change the way neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‰Ûªs and Parkinson‰Ûªs are treated. </p>
<p>Dr. Knebl said she has a vision for expanding the school‰Ûªs work in geriatrics. ‰ÛÏDSWOP‰Ûªs generosity enables us to expand our training opportunities and further develop our clinical research program,‰Û she said. </p>
<p>The endowment is intended to serve as a permanent catalyst for expanding clinical geriatric services to older adults and their caregivers in north Texas. In addition, it allows the health science center to provide expert training and mentoring in geriatrics for medical students, residents and geriatric fellows, Dr. Hahn said.</p>
<p>The endowment is one of many ways DSWOP has demonstrated its support of the health science center. Over the past 20 years, DSWOP has previously given the institution $1.2 million to support loans and scholarships for medical students and to fund the Professional and Continuing Education office. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏDSWOP continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to UNT Health Science Center,‰Û said Joseph LaManna, Sr., DO, DSWOP chair. ‰ÛÏWith this gift, we‰Ûªve more than doubled the amount of support we‰Ûªve provided to the health science center over the years.‰Û</p>
<p>DSWOP, a non-profit organization, was established with proceeds from the 1983 sale of Stevens Park Osteopathic Hospital. It has since distributed almost $13 million in grants to more than 150 organizations.</p>
<p>Dr. Knebl graduated from St. Joseph‰Ûªs University in Philadelphia and the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. She earned a master‰Ûªs in business administration from Texas Christian University in 2002.

The award recognizes the outstanding contributions of physicians to other physicians and health care professionals, to the long-term care community, and to the older population of the state of Texas.</p>

<p>Dr. Russell, who is currently chair of TMDA‰Ûªs Public Policy Committee, served as president of the organization from 1995-1997.  Since opening her practice in Austin in 1984, Dr. Russell, founder of Austin Geriatric Specialists P.A., has committed herself to the care of the elderly. She currently serves as Medical Director of Buckner Villas, Hearthstone Healthcare Center of Round Rock, Odyssey Hospice-Austin, Park Bend Healthcare Center, Sage Brook Healthcare Center, Seton Skilled Nursing Facility and Stonebridge Healthcare Center. From 1995-2000, Dr. Russell served as Medical Director of Geriatric Services for the Seton Community Care Network.  </p>
<p>In presenting the award, Dr. Weinblatt recognized not only Dr. Russell‰Ûªs commitment to her patients, but also her tireless, selfless efforts to improve the quality of long-term care on both a state and national level.  In addition to her position on the TMDA Board of Directors, Dr. Russell currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Travis County Medical Society and as a member of the Texas Medical Association‰Ûªs Council on Health Service Organizations. She also served on the Texas Department of Insurance‰Ûª Task Force for Best Practices for Risk Management & Loss Control for Nursing Homes; as a member of the Nursing Home Workgroup of the Legislative Health and Human Services Board for the State of Texas; as Chair of the TMA‰Ûªs Committee on Aging and Long Term Care and its Ad Hoc Committee on Home Health.  </p>

<p>Dr. Russell, who was recently named the ‰ÛÏtop‰Û geriatrician in Austin by Consumers‰Ûª Checkbook, a non-profit consumer information and service resource, was awarded her medical degree in 1979 from the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, now part of the University of North  Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth, and her B.A. from the University of Texas at Austin. She is a Certified Medical Director, holds Added Qualifications in Geriatric Medicine, and is a Diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine. </p> <p>The Texas Medical Directors Association of Long Term Care Medicine is a statewide non-profit organization whose members are physicians practicing in long term care, and is a chapter of the American Medical Directors Association.  </p>

They become frustrated from the situation and avoid health care providers they can't understand. Sometimes, they avoid seeking care at all. Others travel great distances to seek care from a provider who does speak their language.</p>
<p>The School of Public Health at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth is implementing several new initiatives to improve the situation and enable English-speaking doctors and hospitals to communicate more effectively with their Spanish-speaking patients. The initiatives are part of a new program called <i>Hablenos de su Salud</i>, or Let‰Ûªs Talk About Your Health.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏSpanish-speaking patients often feel that nobody‰Ûªs really listening to what they say,‰Û said Holly Jacobson, PhD, principal investigator for the grant. ‰ÛÏThe program we‰Ûªve developed will try to improve the way we communicate with Spanish-speaking patients. Hopefully, it will have a beneficial effect on the quality of the health care they receive as well.‰Û</p>
<p>The health science center is one of nine health organizations in the country selected to address the growing issue of language barriers in health care by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) through its national program, Hablamos Juntos: Improving Patient-Provider Communication for Latinos.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏPeople with a limited ability to communicate in English face significant barriers to quality health care in the United States,‰Û said Pamela Dickson, senior program officer at RWJF. ‰ÛÏThe nation is becoming more diverse, and we need to take steps toward solving this problem now. Our hope is that the projects developed through the Hablamos Juntos program will ultimately serve as models for other language groups.‰Û</p>
<p>Last year, UNTHSC and other grantees received a one-year planning grant to design innovative and affordable approaches to improve patient-provider communication, including language interpretation services, printed materials and signage. SPH will now receive an additional $850,000 over the next two years to implement the initiatives it proposed. </p>
<p>The health science center will develop practical approaches that will increase the availability and quality of interpreters at collaborating health care provider sites, improve Spanish-language capacity, develop Spanish materials, and create easy-to-understand ways for non-English speaking patients to navigate health care facilities. This will include testing a newly developed system of symbols for health signage that may be more effective at guiding patients than existing written signage.</p>
<p>Through the RWJF grant, the health science center has been working with a diverse group of community partners, including Planned Parenthood of North Texas, Mental Health Mental Retardation of Tarrant County and the American Cancer Society. Other partners include the family medicine clinics operated by the health science center‰Ûªs Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine and by the Osteopathic Health Systems of Texas.  <i>Alianza Comunitaria of Tarrant County</i> and <i>Salud para su Corazon of North Texas</i>, two programs that focus on educating the Latino community about cardiovascular disease, are also integrally involved. </p>
<p>Trained interpreters with the program will be placed in six sites around Tarrant County, including the emergency room at the Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas, JPS Health Center ‰ÛÒ Diamond Hill, and Planned Parenthood‰Ûªs Arlington clinic. The new Fort Worth Northside Community Health Center, the MHMR Tarrant Youth Recovery program, and the American Cancer Society‰Ûªs Hispanic outreach programs are also intervention sites for the program. </p>
<p>UNT Health Science Center is also developing advanced training and education for interpreters that will lead to a Master of Public Health degree in health applied linguistics. The faculty is currently recruiting experienced interpreters to enroll in the new linguistics program. Classes are set to begin in January, and scholarships are available. </p>
<p>The program will also develop materials for patients in original Spanish, instead of translating English-language materials. In addition to educational brochures and posters, the team is working on developing a new process to demonstrate patients‰Ûª informed consent to treatment. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏPatients are often not informed about what they‰Ûªre signing and it‰Ûªs truly not an informed consent,‰Û Dr. Jacobson said. ‰ÛÏAt a minimum, the form needs to be in Spanish, but it‰Ûªs the whole process that needs improving.‰Û</p>
<p>Workshops on interpretation will be offered to help clinic staff improve their ability to work with interpreters. In addition, bilingual clinical staff will participate in language proficiency testing. ‰ÛÏJust because you speak two languages doesn‰Ûªt mean you‰Ûªre qualified to be an interpreter,‰Û Dr. Jacobson said. </p>

<p>Workshops and seminars about the role of language services in the hospital or clinic will also be offered to administrators and managers. ‰ÛÏThey need to know how quality language services can improve their bottom line, minimize their legal responsibilities and influence health care policy,‰Û Dr. Jacobson said. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe recognize that better communication between patients and their health care providers can enhance health care,‰Û said Fernando TreviÌ±o, PhD, MPH, UNTHSC School of Public Health dean. ‰ÛÏWe want to develop ways to improve patient-provider communication today and lay the groundwork so that the situation in the future is even better.‰Û</p>

<p>Researchers from the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth and the University of Florida's McKnight Brain Institute collaborated to discover a critical form estrogen takes that enables it to protect brain cells. </p>
<p>""We discovered a major mechanism by which estrogen protects nerve cells,"" said James Simpkins, PhD, director of UNTHSC's Institute for Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research. ""We now know how estrogen keeps brain cells alive even when exposed to an insult like stroke, Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease."" </p>
<p>""If a compound can retain estrogen's protective benefits and reduce the side effects because the estrogen is produced in a controlled fashion in the body, it could change the way one treats acute events, such as stroke and heart attack, and chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Essentially, patients will be able take advantage of the good effects of estrogen while minimizing the bad effects,"" Dr. Simpkins said. ""Our group has begun evaluating compounds based on this discovery.""</p>
<p>Production of such a drug will require additional experimentation, clinical testing and is at least five years away, Simpkins said.</p>
<p>The research findings are published online in the September 22 issue of the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</i>.</p>
<p>Key to the discovery of the compound was the unraveling of the mystery of how the body naturally regenerates estrogen after a stroke. </p>
<p>During a stroke, free radicals damage important cells in the body, most notably, nerve cells,"" said Laszlo Prokai, PhD, a chemist with UF's College of Pharmacy who discovered the mechanism by which the body regenerates estrogen. ""That's where much of the debilitating effect of the stroke comes from, not from the primary incident - the clogging of the arteries and the shortage of blood - but after the surgeon opens an artery, for example, and the blood starts flowing through the previously blocked territory. Then the reactive oxygen species (free radicals) just start going rampant.""</p>
<p>Free radicals are unbalanced molecules than have lost an electron and try to stabilize themselves by stealing an electron from a nearby molecule, which creates a jumble of high energy particles that ricochet wildly and damage cells. In the case of stroke, the hydroxyl radical - a chemical compound consisting of one atom of hydrogen and one of oxygen - does a large part of the damage.</p>
<p>Estrogen comes to the rescue by capturing the hydroxyl radical.</p>
<p>""In layman's terms, a spill occurs when the blood starts flowing into the blocked territory, and the overflow hydroxyl radical is the spill,"" Dr. Prokai said. ""The estrogen is the mop, soaking up the hydroxyl radicals before they do damage. But when the mop is saturated, you have to squeeze it to continue mopping. This mechanism has never been fully understood before.""</p>
<p>When the estrogen and hydroxyl radicals combine, an unusual molecule called a quinol is produced. In this form, the hydroxyl radicals are harmless, but the estrogen is no longer useful as an antioxidant. Dr. Prokai investigated and discovered chemicals in the body transform the quinol back to estrogen, effectively wringing out the mop and making it useful again.</p>
<p>""It has been talked about for years that estrogen somehow participates in an (antioxidant) cycle, and until this work, no one really knew what the cycle was,"" said Bruce McEwen, PhD, a professor of neuroendocrinology at Rockefeller University in New York. ""The cycle implies that estrogen doesn't have to be used up, that it can be rejuvenated to produce a chemical shield that gets rid of free radicals. Further, you can use tiny amounts of the estrogen derivative to set off this cycle. Showing a mechanism in which these effects can take place is an important step forward.""</p>
<p>In terms of therapies, scientists believe administering the quinol - the saturated mop - will deliver the protective benefits of estrogen, because the body will naturally wring it out and convert it to estrogen, while side effects associated with direct estrogen therapy, such as feminization in men, may remain in check.</p>
<p>This could eventually be a viable alternative to hormone replacement therapy, which is a combination of estrogen plus progestin, a synthetic substance that mimics the hormone progesterone to oppose estrogen's undesirable effects on the uterus. While the natural loss of estrogen as women age may contribute to higher risk of stroke and heart disease, the American Heart Association does not advise women to take hormone replacement therapy. Furthermore, scientists at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in 2002 stopped a large study of such therapy because it increased the risk of invasive breast cancer and blood clots in the legs and lungs and failed to protect women from stroke.</p>

<p>Alejandro Gomez, a Mexican migrant worker living in Dawson County near Lubbock, was reported missing in January. Three months later, cowboys on a nearby ranch found a skeleton with Gomez‰Ûª identification cards, but his identity could not be confirmed through fingerprints or dental records. He was officially declared dead Aug. 22 by the Lubbock County medical examiner after DNA tests on the skeleton matched family reference samples from his mother.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏGomez may be the first missing person we‰Ûªve identified, but he won‰Ûªt be the last,‰Û said Art Eisenberg, PhD, director of the DNA Identity Lab at UNT Health Science Center. ‰ÛÏAs more samples are submitted, our ability to identify missing family members will grow as well.‰Û</p>
<p>Soon after the body was found, the Lynn County Sheriff‰Ûªs Office submitted skeletal remains to the DNA Identity Lab. Analysts processed the skeletal samples for the standard panel of nuclear DNA markers used by the forensic community and for mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother. The results were then uploaded as unidentified remains into the FBI‰Ûªs Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) database. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Dawson County Sheriff‰Ûªs Office submitted family reference samples from Gomez‰Ûª mother to the lab for inclusion in the Texas Missing Persons DNA Database. After the samples were processed, a database search in July gave the first scientific clue that these cases may be linked. Additional DNA testing confirmed Gomez‰Ûª identity.</p>
<p> ‰ÛÏEvery sample submitted to the database undergoes the same process,‰Û said John Planz, PhD, associate director of the lab. ‰ÛÏThe investigators may have suspicions or clues to the identity of the remains, but we rely only on the results of our analysis.‰Û</p>
<p>Texas is the only state to operate its own Missing Persons DNA Database as an additional tool for investigators trying to locate missing persons or identify remains. The project compares DNA samples from family members of missing persons with samples from unidentified bodies, at no charge to law enforcement agencies or the families. </p>
<p>The state legislature established the Texas Missing Persons DNA Database in 2001 with funding from the Texas Crime Victims‰Ûª Compensation Fund. The database began accepting samples from Texas law enforcement agencies earlier this year.</p>
<p>The health science center‰Ûªs DNA Identity Lab has provided scientific and technical support for Texas law enforcement agencies and crime labs for more than 10 years, including paternity testing, forensic genetic screening and DNA testing. The lab is among the few able to conduct mitochondrial forensic DNA analysis and the only state laboratory that can submit mitochondrial DNA profiles directly to the FBI.</p>

            <p>‰ÛÏWe are nationally recognized for quality science,‰Û said James Simpkins, PhD, director of the Institute for Aging & Alzheimer‰Ûªs Disease Research and chair of pharmacology and neuroscience. ‰ÛÏThis confirms the excellence of our scientists and their research.‰Û</p>
            <p>‰ÛÏThe grant will investigate the causes and consequences of normal brain aging,‰Û Dr. Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏWe hope that by better understanding how the brain ages normally, we can pinpoint what happens when there are problems and develop therapies to address conditions like Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease.‰Û</p>
<p>‰ÛÏTo receive a program project grant from the National Institutes of Health, of which the NIA is a part, individual research projects must be part of a program that is connected both theoretically and practically,‰Û Dr. Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏEach of these projects will be better because they are part of this interdependent group,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏThe discoveries made on each project will influence how the other investigations develop.‰Û</p>
<p>The research team includes Michael Forster, PhD, professor; Peter Koulen, PhD, assistant professor; Glenn Dillon, PhD, associate professor; Meharvan Singh, PhD, assistant professor; James Simpkins, PhD, professor and chair; Christopher De Fiebre, PhD, assistant professor, all of pharmacology and neuroscience, and Karan Singh, PhD, chair and professor of biostatistics. The project began Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Dr. Forster is interested in how brain oxidation relates to cognitive decline, coordination and motor skills, both in normal brain aging and in cases of Alzheimer‰Ûªs and Parkinson‰Ûªs disease. In all of the body‰Ûªs cells, the cellular machinery that makes energy produces reactive oxygen molecules called free radicals as a byproduct, he said. The free radicals are unstable and tend to react with other molecules, which is often dangerous to the machinery of other cells, Dr. Forster explained. Because cells are constantly generating energy and therefore producing some level of free radicals, the cells are constantly under attack, or exposed to oxidative stress, since they are always trying to fight off the damaging free radical molecules. </p>
<p>With aging, the battle is progressively lost, so the cells keep getting more and more damaged, Dr. Forster said. Brain cells do not typically replicate, so they cannot replace themselves, and over time, their function is disrupted. Once the cells begin to become damaged, they produce more free radicals, creating more damage and becoming trapped in this vicious cycle. Dr. Forster is investigating whether oxidative stress is a cause of Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease and other milder age-related changes in the brain. ‰ÛÏIf we understand how oxidative stress causes normal brain aging, we would have a lot of insight into how it is involved in Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Koulen is studying a specific set of proteins inside nerve cells that are critical to the cells‰Ûª functions and influence the properties of nerve cells affected with Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease and age-related cognitive impairment. These proteins are responsible for controlling the release of calcium from stores inside a cell into the cell, which is important because small changes in calcium concentration and the shape and size of these changes are used by nerve cells to mediate important processes in the brain. Dr. Koulen said his team‰Ûªs goal is to determine where, how and when such changes occur in established model systems for Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease and age-related cognitive impairment.</p>
            <p>Drs. Meharvan Singh and Dillon are working together to study how progesterone relates to brain aging and understand how it communicates with the inside of the cell. Dr. Dillon is concentrating on channels called GABA-A receptors that let chloride into the cell. When the GABA-A receptor is activated, it causes the inhibition, or slowing down, of that cell‰Ûªs activity. They theorize that long-term inhibition may underlie the nerve dysfunction that takes place in age-related diseases, Dr. Singh said. They believe that progesterone may help alleviate the slowing down of the nerve cells by inhibiting the GABA-A receptor so that it stops letting chloride into the cells. </p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Singh is studying the involvement of specific sequences of biochemical events called signal transduction pathways and the regulation of certain proteins called neurotrophins that may help protect the nerve cell from age-related brain dysfunction. He said they hope that by better understanding the biology of aging, they may be able to develop treatments for the prevention of age-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Dr. Simpkins is studying the normal role of estrogens in brain structure and function during aging. His research addresses the impact of estrogen loss at menopause on cognitive decline, nerve cell loss and the changes in the brain that occur in Alzheimer's disease. This research is built on a foundation of evidence that estrogens serve to protect the brain from many age related conditions. Further, in collaboration with Dr. Meharvan Singh, he will determine the effects of combined therapy with estrogens and progesterones on age-related changes in brain function.</p>
<p>Dr. De Fiebre will analyze learning ability, or cognition, and psychomotor skills using laboratory models.  He is interested in how these brain functions decline with aging in some individuals, but not in others. Dr. De Fiebre is hoping to gain an understanding of why some individuals demonstrate brain aging while others do not. ‰ÛÏBy identifying the biochemical basis of brain aging, drugs or other treatments might be able to be developed to slow or reverse this debilitating and costly problem,"" he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Karan Singh and other biostatisticians from the School of Public Health will provide centralized statistical services and collaborative research support to the program projects and monitor the quality of experimental designs and statistical analyses. They will provide statistical expertise for the design, data management and analysis for the research projects. </p> 
<p>‰ÛÏWe will be responsible for taking the enormous amounts of data the program project grant will generate and analyzing it to determine how the research findings are most significantly related to brain aging,‰Û he said.</p>

James Simpkins, PhD, chair of pharmacology and neuroscience, will oversee the five-year project, ‰ÛÏPredoctoral Training in the Neurobiology of Aging.‰Û</p>
<p>As baby boomers reach retirement age and diseases related to brain aging become more common, it is even more important to find the causes of aging and to treat and prevent these diseases, Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏThis program is a vital part of an overall effort of the health science center to enhance training  and research  in the causes, treatments and prevention of brain aging and its consequential diseases.‰Û</p>
<p>In Fort Worth alone, more than 65,000 people are over the age of 65 ‰ÛÒ more than 10 percent of the city‰Ûªs residents ‰ÛÒ making it a prime place for research about the aging population. 
The ‰ÛÏgraying‰Û population is a worldwide phenomenon. According to the NIA, the world‰Ûªs 65-and-older population is growing by more than 800,000 people a month.  NIA and U.S. Census Bureau data indicate that the average citizen in most industrialized countries has a life expectancy of 76-78 years, and many countries, including Japan and Singapore, have average life expectancies extending into the 80s.</p>
<p>According to the Alzheimer‰Ûªs Disease Educational and Referral Center, as many as four million American suffer from Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease ‰ÛÓ about three percent of men and women between 65 and 74, and nearly half of Americans over the age of 85.</p>
<p>The training program will be conducted through the health science center‰Ûªs Institute for Aging and Alzheimer‰Ûªs Disease Research, of which Simpkins is the director. </p>
          <p>Participants will be selected from doctoral students from the four basic science departments: pharmacology and neuroscience, integrative physiology, molecular biology, and immunology and pathology. DO/PhD students will also be eligible to apply. </p>
<p>Once selected, trainees will participate in several new activities, including a neurobiology of aging course, seminar series and journal club, in addition to the regular requirements of the students‰Ûª principal departments. Each spring, a symposium will feature seminar presentations by the trainees, followed by a discussion of their research or their research plans. The symposium will be open to preceptors, funded trainees and other interested individuals.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThis training program is ideal for the health science center,‰Û Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏIn 2001 the Texas Legislature granted funding for our Biotechnology Center, which will house the health science center‰Ûªs aging institute, providing an additional site for training our predoctoral fellows. Our proposed preceptors have a strong record of training undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. They are well funded and well published in the neurobiology of aging.‰Û</p>
<p>The NIA‰Ûªs mission includes improving the health and well-being of older Americans by supporting and conducting research on the aging process, age-related diseases, and special problems and needs of the elderly.</p>

 ",,,,,190,2/1/03 0:00,SURGEONS OFFER WEIGHT LOSS BREAKTHROUGH,"<p>Celebrities such as Al Roker from NBC‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏToday‰Û show and singer Carnie Wilson are showing off their new physiques and crediting their sudden weight loss to gastric bypass surgery. But a newer surgery, called laparoscopic gastric banding, may be a better option for obese people considering surgery as a solution to their weight problems and related health issues.</p>
<p>Last winter, surgeons at UNT Health Science Center became the first in Tarrant County to perform laparoscopic gastric band surgery, the latest surgical advance in weight-loss surgery. Adam Smith, DO, and German Berbel, DO, surgeons with the Physicians & Surgeons Medical Group at the health science center, have performed more than 50 gastric band surgeries in the last year. They currently perform the surgery at Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas and Harris Hospital Northwest in Azle.</p>
<p>The operation is a minimally invasive surgery that involves placing an inflatable, adjustable prosthesis, the BioEnterics LAP-BAND Systemå¨, around the upper part of the stomach 1 1/2 to 2 inches below the esophagus to create a small pouch that restricts food intake to one to two ounces at a time. </p>
<p>By creating a smaller gastric pouch, the procedure limits the amount of food that the stomach will hold so that the patient will feel comfortably full with small amounts of food. The inflatable ring also controls the flow of food from the pouch to the rest of the digestive tract. The stomach empties more slowly, which allows the patient to continue to feel full for several hours, reducing the urge to eat between meals. </p>
<p>Laparoscopic gastric band surgery is an alternative to gastric bypass surgery, currently the most common surgical procedure used for severe obesity in America. In gastric bypass surgery, part of the stomach is stapled, and part of the intestine is rerouted.</p>
<p>Dr. Smith said the lap band method has several advantages over the traditional gastric bypass; no cutting or stapling of the stomach is required, it is adjustable, and it can be removed. In addition, laparoscopic surgery reduces surgical trauma and pain and is less invasive for both the abdominal wall and the stomach than traditional <p>surgery.</p>
 ‰ÛÏLaparoscopic surgery is much safer than a traditional gastric bypass on all levels,‰Û Dr. Smith said. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre not altering the physiology of the digestive system. Patients still have their whole stomach so there‰Ûªs no permanent alteration of the anatomy.‰Û</p>
<p> ‰ÛÏSince we‰Ûªre not stapling the stomach or cutting it in any way, there‰Ûªs no chance for malabsorption or leakage, as there is with other gastric bypass methods,‰Û Dr. Smith said. </p>
<p>The band has the additional benefit of being adjustable. The amount of food that patients are able to digest at one time can be changed as needed by deflating the band or inflating the band with saline, which is inserted through a tube connected to a titanium port that is sewn into the abdomen, Dr. Berbel said. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏWhat if a patient chooses to become pregnant? Her gastric band can be loosened for the duration of her pregnancy and then re-adjusted,‰Û said Susan Franks, PhD, one of three health psychologists who work with the surgeons. ‰ÛÏOr what if a patient needs surgery? The band can be adjusted to accommodate those needs,‰Û she said.</p>
<p>The band can also be removed if needed, completely reversing the surgery, Dr. Berbel said. 
To be considered for the surgery, prospective patients must meet the clinical definition of ‰ÛÏmorbidly obese,‰Û generally weighing at least twice their ideal weight or at least 100 pounds more than their ideal weight. This degree of excess weight may considerably reduce life expectancy and is associated with numerous health conditions, including diabetes and heart disease, Dr. Berbel said.</p>
<p>Patients considering the surgery should understand that ‰ÛÏit‰Ûªs not a magic wand that immediately produces dramatic results,‰Û Dr. Smith said. ‰ÛÏLap-Band surgery is a tool that helps these patients lose weight. It‰Ûªs one component of a fundamental lifestyle change.‰Û</p>
<p>Patients who choose the health science center for gastric band surgery have the additional benefit of a collaborative on-site team of health professionals. In addition to the surgeon, potential patients meet with a health psychologist and a clinical dietician</p>. 
<p>‰ÛÏOur patients don‰Ûªt have to be referred to outside specialists and then have to make separate appointments and drive to different places,‰Û Dr. Smith said. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre a one-stop shop.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Franks and fellow health psychologists Jerry McGill, PhD, associate professor of manipulative medicine, and James Hall, PhD, associate professor of internal medicine, assess patients‰Ûª readiness for the surgery. 
‰ÛÏPatients eat for a reason, and some of those reasons have psychological basis,‰Û Dr. McGill said. ‰ÛÏWe need to <p>deal with those issues first and get them under control before they go through surgery.‰Û</p>
‰ÛÏWe work with them before surgery so that we understand them enough to help them succeed post-operatively,‰Û Dr. Hall said.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting with a health psychologist, each potential patient also undergoes a one-hour assessment with Sharon Yurvati, MS, RD, LD, a clinical dietician. Yurvati and the patient discuss eating habits, medications, past attempts to lose weight, nutritional needs and other dietary issues related to the surgery. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏPatients make a choice about the food they eat,‰Û Yurvati said. ‰ÛÏI work with them to make sure that they understand the limitations of the surgery and how it will affect the food choices they make.‰Û</p>
<p>Patients may need to consult with additional specialists before surgery. ‰ÛÏMany of these patients suffer from multiple health problems related to their weight,‰Û Dr. Smith said. ‰ÛÏThey may also need to see a specialist to make sure their heart is healthy enough for anesthesia or to make sure that their medications can be tolerated by a smaller stomach.‰Û</p>
<p>The surgery takes about 90 to 120 minutes in the operating room, followed by an overnight stay in the hospital for observation. The patients then have the LAP-BAND filled with saline at their physician‰Ûªs office.
After the procedure, patients slowly move from a protein-fortified liquid diet to soft foods. After about a month, they can usually resume eating some solid foods and participating in strenuous activities, Dr. Smith said. 
‰ÛÏSome foods, such as bread or red meat, may be poorly tolerated,‰Û Yurvati said. ‰ÛÏA lot depends on how well they chew their food before swallowing.‰Û</p>
<p>The health science center coordinates an after-care therapy group that meets twice monthly. Group participants discuss their feelings about weight and the role of food in their lives, and they also address how others are reacting to their weight loss.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏFood plays an important role in obese people‰Ûªs lives and families,‰Û Dr. McGill said. ‰ÛÏAs their weight <p>problems diminish, it may change the dynamic of communication within the family.‰Û </p>
‰ÛÏWe discuss their perceptions about food and help them adjust to a new lifestyle,‰Û Dr. Hall said. ‰ÛÏThis is part of an overall behavior change that touches every aspect of their lives.‰Û</p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe encourage their progress and help them build the support network they need to reach their goal,‰Û Dr. Franks said.</p>
<p>Patients also continue to meet with Yurvati regularly for the first year after their surgery to evaluate their progress and address any dietetic concerns.</p>
<p>Before the surgery, these patients may have been suffering from diabetes, heart disease, degenerative joint pain, constant back pain, dermatitis, and a long list of other weight-related problems, Dr. Berbel said. 
‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs heart-warming to hear patients talk about how their weight loss has affected their lives,‰Û he said. </p>
<p>Some patients have been able to return to work after being out on disability, some have reduced their need for medication for weight-related health problems, some no longer use canes, and others are tying shoes for the first time in years and no longer being bruised by the steering wheel. </p>
<p>These types of patient success stories are not the only by-products of the surgery. The team is now conducting research, funded by a health science center faculty research grant, into other effects of the surgery. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre looking at their eating habits and comparing them before the surgery and post-operatively,‰Û Dr. Franks said. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre also studying the psychological impact of weight loss on their quality of life.‰Û </p>
<p>The team is also working with Joan Carroll, PhD, assistant professor of integrative physiology, to study how the laparoscopic banding affects levels of Ghrelin, a chemical thought to play a role in turning appetite on and off.
‰ÛÏPatients consistently tell us that their appetites change after surgery,‰Û Dr. Franks said. ‰ÛÏWe are trying to find out what happens physiologically to explain that.‰Û</p>
 
<p>The LAP-BAND Systemå¨ has been used extensively in Europe and Australia and was approved by the FDA for use in the United States in the fall of 2000. The surgery costs about $21,500 and will not be covered by insurance in most cases, Dr. Smith said.</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,189,11/1/02 0:00,PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS ADDRESS HYPERTENSION,"<p>Public health leaders from around Tarrant County are working together to address hypertension and other public health issues in the community.</p>
<p>Douglas Mains, DrPH, assistant professor of health management and policy in the health science center‰Ûªs School of Public Health, is a member of a Texas-based team participating in the National Public Health Leadership Institute. Others from Tarrant County include Lou Brewer, RN, MPH, director of the Tarrant County Public Health Department, Dan Reimer, MPH, director of the City of Fort Worth Public Health Department, and Barclay Berdan, president of Harris Methodist Fort Worth Hospital. </p>
<p>About 15 teams of public health professionals from around the country are involved in the national leadership development program. As part of the two-year program, the teams learn about public health issues and develop their skills in addressing those issues. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThrough the training, members develop individual leadership skills while their institution benefits from their increased networking and knowledge. At the same time, we‰Ûªre working on programs that help the entire community,‰Û Dr. Mains said.</p>
<p>The Texas team has helped the ‰ÛÏHealthy Tarrant County‰Û collaboration address hypertension, or high blood pressure, as an emerging health issue in Tarrant County. Healthy Tarrant County is a partnership involving local hospitals, public health departments, social service agencies and UNT Health Science Center.</p>
<p>According to American Heart Association statistics, more than 31 percent of people with high blood pressure are unaware that they have it. In addition, 26 percent of people with high blood pressure are on medication for it, but do not have it under control.</p>
<p>The project involves an in-depth intervention in the Stop Six neighborhood of Fort Worth, an area identified as having a population with a high incidence of hypertension. Surveys have been conducted in schools, restaurants and selected worksites to assess current behaviors and identify possible improvements. Church members in the neighborhood have also been trained to educate their fellow parishioners on the health issue. Each church was supplied with a blood pressure cuff and other tools to help assess high blood pressure.</p>
<p>The group is also developing a countywide hypertension awareness campaign that will use community newspapers and other media to distribute educational messages. </p>
<p>The team‰Ûªs work with Healthy Tarrant County recently received recognition on a national level. The national PHLI selected the Texas team as one of three runners up for its 2002 Balderson Leadership Project Award. The team will receive a certificate, a cash award and the opportunity to present the project during the American Public Health Association‰Ûªs conference this month in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏHealthy Tarrant County builds bridges between the various agencies,‰Û Dr. Mains said. ‰ÛÏThe agencies are already acquainted with each other, but through the collaboration, we‰Ûªve truly become a team focused on the community‰Ûªs health.‰Û</p>
<p>After spending the last year training in the National Public Health Leadership Institute program, the team is now working with the Texas Public Health Leadership Institute to develop a statewide training program.
The team is reviewing the Texas institute‰Ûªs curriculum to ensure that it contains the most current information and working with the board to develop a pilot program in north Texas. It is also assisting with funding requests to address the ongoing need for program funding.</p>
<p>Dr. Mains is not the first to represent the health science center in the national institute. Adela Gonzalez, PhD, vice president for institutional and strategic affairs, and Bob Galvan, MPH, associate dean of the School of Public Health, are both graduates of the national program. Galvan now serves as chair of the board for the Texas institute.

<p>###</p>",,,,,188,2/1/03 0:00,GSBS PROFESSOR EMPHASIZES FAMILY APPROACH,"<p>Stephen Grant, PhD, associate professor of integrative physiology, believes in the power of mentoring. </p>
<p>Dr. Grant, who was chosen as the 2002 Outstanding Graduate Faculty Member by students in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at UNT Health Science Center, emphasizes the importance of senior students teaching junior students and guiding them in their studies and research. Dr. Grant also allows students latitude to pursue their individual research interests. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏI run my lab like a family. Students have their own identity and space, but they also have to support and contribute to the family,‰Û Dr. Grant said. ‰ÛÏThe senior students, like the older siblings in a family, mentor the junior students.‰Û </p>
<p>Dr. Grant, who describes himself as ‰ÛÏstubborn and unconventional,‰Û believes his family approach is the reason his lab and the students in it have been successful. ‰ÛÏNinety percent of what goes on in my lab isn‰Ûªt about me, it‰Ûªs about the senior students mentoring those below them,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏBy their last year with me, they‰Ûªre more like my colleagues than my students. I‰Ûªm successful because they‰Ûªre successful.‰Û </p>

<p>Driven by an infectious sense of curiosity, Dr. Grant challenges students to remain inquisitive. ‰ÛÏYou have to have a hunger to chase science,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏIt should be what gets you out of bed every morning.‰Û
In keeping with that belief, Dr. Grant encourages students to pursue their own research interests, rather than assigning them tasks from one of his grants. He has several students exploring ideas that are not yet funded, but he expects their research will result in future grants. ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm like a military pilot training young flyers, not to do my projects, but to do their own,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏStudent ideas are where science really germinates.‰Û </p>
<p>The students in his lab apply molecular biology and genetics, with research aimed primarily at discovering new drugs and methods to treat cardiovascular disease. Student interests range from functional genomics, a method allowing researchers to look at an expression of all the genes in an organ, such as the heart, to transgenics, where laboratory models expressing certain genes are created and studied. </p>
<p>Dr. Grant expects his students to be high achievers, and takes them to high profile national conferences so they can see what is expected of scientists at that level. ‰ÛÏMy goal for each of my students is the national level, whether they pursue academics or industry,‰Û Dr. Grant said. ‰ÛÏI believe the sooner you show them what‰Ûªs expected of them, the sooner they will perform.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Grant‰Ûªs belief in aiming high is contagious, infecting his students as well. They have high expectations not only for themselves, but also for each other, he said. ‰ÛÏThey constantly want to teach and mentor the students under them.‰Û</p>
He also guides them in their preparation of manuscripts and presentations, and he often requires multiple drafts. <p>He applies his family approach to all aspects of his lab, including grant writing. ‰ÛÏWriting grants is a team effort,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏBoth junior and senior students help me prepare grants. Then, when they have to write a grant for their qualifying exam to become a PhD candidate, they‰Ûªve had experience doing it.‰Û </p>
<p>Tom Valencia, MS, a research scientist in Dr. Grant‰Ûªs lab and a part-time doctoral student at the health science center, testifies to the success of Dr. Grant‰Ûªs approach. He serves as the senior ‰ÛÏfamily member‰Û in the lab, mentoring and supervising junior students, Dr. Grant said. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏIn the lab, Dr. Grant leaves it up to our ingenuity to design our experiments. He just directs the way he wants the research to go,‰Û Valencia said. ‰ÛÏDr. Grant has also guided me through the scientific writing process as I prepare grants and papers.‰Û Valencia said also believes the ‰ÛÏfamily approach has allowed the lab to become a very close knit group. We try to resolve any problems or concerns among the family before going to Dr. Grant.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Grant is the director of the division of cardiac and vascular molecular genetics in the health science center‰Ûªs Cardiovascular Research Institute. Prior to joining the institution, Dr. Grant was a research assistant professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He received his master‰Ûªs and doctoral degrees in biochemistry from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Dr. Grant presented synopses of student research being performed in his lab in November during the Outstanding Graduate Faculty Seminar Series, sponsored by the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and the Graduate Student Association. </p>
<p>Outstanding Graduate Faculty are selected based on their commitment to higher education, involvement in graduate education and dedication to the student body, said Carla Lee, director of graduate admissions and services for the graduate school.</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,187,2/1/03 0:00,DNA TECHNOLOGY RENEWS SEARCH FOR MISSING PERSONS,"<p>Families looking sadly at faded photographs, wondering about the fate of their missing loved one.
Detectives tracking down clues to years-old cases that began with a simple missing persons report. 
Medical examiners trying to put a name to the John Doe who has stayed on their minds since he first arrived in the morgue.
These are just a few of the people who gain a new sense of hope from Texas‰Ûª Missing Persons DNA Database at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.</p>
 
<h4>Texas Leads the Way</h4>
<p>Texas is the first state to participate in the federal database for missing persons, now that the health science center‰Ûªs DNA Identity Laboratory is part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation‰Ûªs Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).
CODIS, a network of databases containing DNA samples, blends forensic science and computer technology into an effective tool for solving crime by allowing federal, state and local crime labs to electronically exchange and compare DNA profiles, helping to connect related crimes to each other and link them to convicted offenders. </p>
<p>The information in CODIS is maintained in separate databases with shared access privileges. Each database contains DNA samples from missing persons or their relatives and samples from unidentified remains that are collected at the local, state and federal levels. Samples are first compared with others in the Texas database. If no match is found, the samples are loaded into CODIS to expand the search nationally. 
The lab officially went online with CODIS in December. New York and California are establishing similar statewide missing persons DNA database systems and will soon participate in the national system, said John Planz, PhD, the lab‰Ûªs associate director.</p>
<p>Before joining CODIS, the health science center had to first become accredited as a forensic lab. Either the National Forensic Science Technology Center or the American Crime Laboratory Directors ‰ÛÒ Laboratory Accreditation Board must certify forensic labs before they can participate in CODIS. </p>
<p>The health science center became the first academic institution to earn NFSTC accreditation in September by proving its compliance with national quality assurance standards for forensic DNA testing laboratories, said Stephen Putthoff, DO, chair of pathology. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏEvery aspect of every test we run may now be judged by the legal system, not by our scientific peers,‰Û said Joe Warren, PhD, assistant director of the DNA Identity Lab. ‰ÛÏAttorneys, judges, and juries want to be reassured that they should believe the evidence that our work provides, and being accredited strengthens our credibility in the courtroom.‰Û</p>
<p>Fingerprints or dental records can be used to identify people in many circumstances, but when detectives have only skeletal remains or fragments of bone, they must rely on DNA testing. Mitochondrial DNA testing, such as that conducted at the health science center, can use the smallest fragments of materials like strands of hair, or samples in bad condition where cellular DNA is highly decomposed, Dr. Planz said.
The health science center‰Ûªs lab is one of 17 facilities in North America capable of conducting mitochondrial DNA analysis, he said.</p>
<p>Usually, DNA profiles originate with a local agency, then flow to the state and national levels, but the DNA Identity Lab will bypass this tiered system and work directly with the national database maintained by the FBI because of the specific type of data it will submit, Dr. Planz said.
‰ÛÏWe are the first non-federal lab eligible to contribute mitochondrial DNA test results directly into CODIS,‰Û Dr. Warren said. ‰ÛÏWith this direct connection to the FBI, we‰Ûªll be able to submit samples and query the database ourselves.‰Û</p>

<h4>Families Provide the Key</h4>
<p>Besides solving crimes, CODIS has a separate component that focuses solely on DNA samples from unidentified human remains and missing persons. This part of CODIS will be an integral part of the Texas Missing Persons DNA Database at the health science center‰Ûªs DNA lab.</p>
<p>The 77th Texas Legislature designated the DNA Identity Lab as the home of its missing persons database in 2001 and provided $1 million from the Crime Victims‰Ûª Compensation Fund to acquire the technology needed to establish the database.</p>
<p>The database makes it possible to identify missing people through the use of family reference samples, similar to the methods used to identify the victims of 2001‰Ûªs terrorist attacks, Dr. Planz said. Lab technicians will perform DNA analysis consistent with FBI methods, and the data will be uploaded into the federal database.
These methods rely on the theory that all humans, except for identical twins, have unique sequences of DNA. Comparing these individual sequences to other samples is now the most advanced and accurate means to identify people or link family members. DNA testing can identify a person with better than 99 percent accuracy, Dr. Planz said.</p>
<p>In identity testing, samples of DNA are collected from a specimen of blood, saliva, bones, teeth, hair or other tissues. These samples provide a profile, or ‰ÛÏfingerprint,‰Û of the individual, he said. They can then be compared to other DNA profiles to establish an accurate identity. Dr. Planz said the most useful samples come from medical specimens, such as a bone marrow donor sample, blood sample or biopsy taken from recent medical tests or procedures. A DNA sample can also be taken from personal items such as a toothbrush or hairbrush, he said. </p>

<p>DNA from close relatives such as a biological parent or sibling can be useful, and in some instances a match may be obtained through sample indexing with the DNA of other relatives, such as half-siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles. In many if not most cases, reference samples from both parents and all or several siblings are necessary to improve the accuracy of the test, Dr. Planz said.</p>
 
<h4>From Near and Far</h4>
<p>The national network of databases also allows bodies to be identified even though the remains were found far from where people were reported missing. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏNow that we have a direct link with the FBI, law enforcement agencies from around the country will have access to our records,‰Û Dr. Planz said. ‰ÛÏWithout the national network of databases, a body may never be identified simply because it wasn‰Ûªt found near its hometown. We hope that our efforts will help unsolved cases from Texas and the rest of the country to eventually be closed.‰Û</p>
<p>The DNA lab at the health science center started accepting samples from medical examiners‰Ûª offices and Texas law enforcement agencies Jan. 1. </p>
<p>Some of the first samples were submitted by the Harris County Medical Examiner‰Ûªs Office. Staff there hope the database will help identify more than 70 skeletal remains from unknown individuals. Once their identity is known, their families can be notified and the remains can be released to the relatives.</p>
<p>The health science center is working closely with the Texas Department of Public Safety and its Missing Persons Clearinghouse to raise awareness of the database among law enforcement agencies. The clearinghouse serves as a liaison between law enforcement agencies and the public, assisting agencies with missing persons cases and families who have a missing loved one. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏIn Texas alone, 70,000 people are reported missing each year, and 90 percent of them are under 18,‰Û said Heidi Fischer, program specialist with the clearinghouse. ‰ÛÏMany of these cases are closed relatively quickly, but some remain open for years.‰Û The clearinghouse has about 450 active cases involving unidentified individuals in its files, she said. That number may not reflect additional cases that have not yet been entered into clearinghouse records by law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>All Texas law enforcement agencies are required to enter identifying features of a person reported missing into the National Crime Information Center. When submitted, this initial report automatically becomes part of the clearinghouse records, too, she said. 
They are also required to enter information about any unidentified bodies into the NCIC and clearinghouse files.</p>
<p>Fischer said the DNA database at the health science center offers the clearinghouse a new avenue to solve these open cases that is beyond the scope of traditional identification efforts.</p>
<p>Cases involving missing children will receive top priority for analysis. The database will eventually help in a variety of missing persons cases, including cases involving kidnapped children, runaways, the physically or mentally disabled, and those missing after a catastrophe. 
‰ÛÏIf we consider the pain and suffering the families of missing people are going through, even one body identified is worth the effort,‰Û said Joe Mathew, PhD, DNA technical advisor at the Harris County Medical Examiner‰Ûªs Office.</p>
<p>###</p>",,,,,186,7/1/03 0:00,PROGRAM HELPS IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF LOCAL HISPANIC FAMILIES,"<p><i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n</i>, or Health for Your Heart, has impacted the lives and health of almost 200 local Hispanic families since it began in 2001. The program, implemented locally by the School of Public Health at UNT Health Science Center, trains lay health educators, or <i>promotores</i>, to bring heart-healthy messages to their communities.</p>
           <p> ‰ÛÏMany Hispanics are unaware of preventive measures to reduce the risk of heart disease, and cultural factors such as language barriers predispose Latinos not to have access to public health messages and health education,‰Û said principal investigator Hector Balcazar, PhD, chair and professor of social and behavioral sciences in the School of Public Health. ‰ÛÏThis is especially problematic because cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Latinos, and they have a disproportionate distribution of many of the risk factors for heart disease,‰Û he said.</p>

           <p> Preliminary results from the first group of families completing the program indicate that the <i>promotores </i>have had a positive impact on the families they counseled and have been successfully communicating their message, said project co-director Mary Luna Hollen, PhD, RD, LD. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe families made healthier lifestyle choices and better understood the health effects of factors such as salt and sodium intake, cholesterol and fat, and weight control. The mothers also became more physically active, which may influence other family members to exercise more,‰Û she said. </p>
            <p>The <i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n</i> team consists of 19 <i>promotores</i>, 29 network partner organizations and 10 public health students from the health science center. Participating families were divided into two groups and given a ‰ÛÏpre-test‰Û to determine their behaviors and practices regarding various health-related subjects, she said.</p>
<p>The first group took part in six comprehensive family sessions on healthy lifestyle behaviors presented in Spanish by the <i>promotores</i>, who followed the families for six months, Dr. Hollen said.</p>
<p>Those families also received culturally sensitive health education on cardiovascular risk factors, physical activity, blood pressure and sodium, cholesterol and fat, healthy weight, and diet. <i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n</i> participants in this group have shown an increased understanding about how to lead healthier lifestyles, based on their responses to a ‰ÛÏpost-test‰Û given after they completed the program, Dr. Hollen said.</p>
<p>The second group of families is a comparison group designed to determine the effect of the <i>promotora</i>. ‰ÛÏWe are determining if meeting with a <i>promotora </i>is more effective than traditional classroom settings or written material,‰Û she said. The families in the second group receive monthly educational materials by mail, a monthly telephone call and a post card every two to three months, but are not attending the <i>promotora </i>family sessions. Results from this group are expected to be analyzed later this year.</p>
          <p>In August, a third group of 20-25 families will be studied for three months to gather more information about the effects of meeting with a <i>promotora</i>. The participants will include people already on medication for heart disease, diabetes or high blood pressure. They will participate in the six-lesson family session conducted by the <i>promotores</i>, who will target their sessions to address the families‰Ûª risk factors and health conditions, Dr. Hollen said. </p>
<p>The families in this clinical sample will be followed for a three-month period, and will also receive information by mail and phone calls from the <i>promotora</i>. Health science center researchers will assess the effect of the program by comparing the families‰Ûª answers on a test before starting the program to their answers after completing it. </p>
‰ÛÏThe program has been very well received by the community. Families become very connected with the promotora and many family participants want to become a <i>promotora </i>themselves,‰Û said Dr. Hollen. 
<p>‰ÛÏThe <i>Salud para su Cor</i>azÌ_n program was tailor-made to meet the needs of Latino families,‰Û Dr. Balcazar said. ‰ÛÏThe <i>promotores </i>believe that our communities are like flowers, and we are to care for them and water them with ‰Û÷droplets‰Ûª of health information. It‰Ûªs a team effort where all voices are heard and all ideas are used.‰Û</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe <i>promotores </i>are so dedicated to the program they will keep meeting with each other and with families on a volunteer basis after the formal program ends in January,‰Û Dr. Hollen said. ‰ÛÏA network of <i>promotores </i>and partner organizations is forming to pursue future support and funding of the program. Many of the network partners will also continue to provide supplies, meeting facilities and other support.‰Û Partners include hospitals, churches, community nonprofit organizations and many others. </p>
            <p>The School of Public Health team is developing a model, complete with a multi-media CD-ROM, to show others how they implemented <i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n </i>and why the program is important. Planning, promotora training and evaluation will be among the topics discussed. They presented their recommendations in June at the national conference of the Society of Public Health Educators in New Mexico.</p>
           <p> <i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n </i>was created by the National Institutes of Health‰Ûªs National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in 1994 as a pilot project in Washington, DC. It now serves communities in Texas, Illinois, New Mexico and California. The School of Public Health was one of six organizations across the country selected to form the foundation of a national effort to educate people in low-income and minority communities about cardiovascular disease. The health science center received $429,000 over three years from the NHLBI to implement the program.</p>

 ",,,,,185,7/1/03 0:00,HSC RESEARCH SEEKS ANSWER TO PMDD TRIGGER,"<p>Health science center researchers are trying to identify a possible cause of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which may aid in the development of new treatments.</p>
<p>Meharvan Singh, PhD, assistant professor of pharmacology and neuroscience, is the principal investigator in a study funded by a $60,000 grant from the National Alliance for Research in Schizophrenia and Depression and a $15,000 UNTHSC faculty research grant.</p>
<p>Dr. Singh and Glenn Dillon, PhD, associate professor of pharmacology and neuroscience, are investigating the interaction between the hormone progesterone and the GABAA receptor, a protein that, when activated, acts as the main ‰ÛÏbrake‰Û that helps tone down the activation, or firing, of nerve cells in the brain.
‰ÛÏThe symptoms of PMDD are related to premenstrual syndrome, but are so severe that they often interfere with a woman‰Ûªs daily life,‰Û Dr. Singh said. </p>
<p>The disorder affects 3 to 8 percent of women, generally those in their 20s and 30s. Symptoms, including severe depression, irritability and mood swings, start seven to 14 days before menstruation and end a few days after menstruation begins, according to Medem, an online medical library founded by the nation‰Ûªs leading medical societies.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏHistorically, PMDD was thought to be due to reduced progesterone levels. However, the period when women are most susceptible to the symptoms of PMDD is when progesterone levels are high,‰Û Dr. Singh said. ‰ÛÏSo, if you think of the symptoms of PMDD as a state of hyper-anxiety or extreme excitability, this state may be toned down if you activate the GABA-A brake. Alternatively, the symptoms could become evident or worsen if you block the brake,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>Drs. Singh and Dillon have found that progesterone directly inhibits, or shuts off, the braking activities of the GABA-A receptor, which may trigger PMDD symptoms in some women. They believe that this inhibition of GABA-A is part of the biology of PMDD, and their research focuses on understanding the processes by which progesterone inhibits GABA-A.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏUnderstanding the biology of PMDD is important because it allows us to come up with new treatment strategies,‰Û Dr. Singh said. ‰ÛÏPMDD is a multifaceted disorder, but the interaction between progesterone and GABA-A could be a therapeutic target. Understanding the basic science aspects of the relationship between these two elements is potentially relevant to developing clinical treatments for PMDD.‰Û</p>
<p>More specifically, Drs. Singh and Dillon are investigating the connection between a certain signaling, or communication, pathway and its influence on the GABA-A receptor. This pathway, called the MAPK pathway, is activated by progesterone. </p>
<p>Signaling pathways are characterized by the sequential activation of proteins within a cell that tell the cell what to do or how to respond when a hormone or drug arrives at its surface, Dr. Singh said. </p>
<p>The researchers believe the MAPK pathway is one of the ways progesterone communicates with the GABA-A receptor. ‰ÛÏIf we can understand how the MAPK pathway facilitates communication between progesterone and GABA-A, the pathway may also be a potential target for therapy. Understanding the communication mechanism may allow us to alter the communication,‰Û Dr. Singh said.</p>
<p>NARSAD is exclusively devoted to supporting research on brain and behavior disorders, according to its web site. It supports scientists around the world who study the causes and treatment of severe psychiatric disorders. </p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,184,7/1/03 0:00,YEAST MAY HOLD CLUES TO CANCER RESEARCH,"<p>It sounds like one of those too-good-to-be-true advertisements in a health magazine: ‰ÛÏCommon baker‰Ûªs yeast from your kitchen cabinet could hold the key to curing cancer.‰Û</p>
 
<p>Yet, a researcher whose work could be titled just that has recently joined UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs Department of Cell Biology and Genetics.</p>
 
<p>Wolfram Siede, PhD, a cell biologist who previously worked at the Emory University School of Medicine, is using common yeast to seek answers to how human cells defend against and repair cancer-causing damage to DNA caused by environmental stress. His latest study is part of a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences multi-study project funded at $1.2 million a year for five years.</p>
 
<p>Dr. Siede‰Ûªs team is one of five separate but collaborative initiatives, each investigating a different aspect of DNA repair, damage tolerance and damage prevention in response to exposures to radiation or chemical agents that can corrupt cellular DNA.</p>
 
<p>Why yeast? Because it is a single-cell model organism of simple structure, and its DNA sequence was already determined several years ago, Dr. Siede said. Since yeast‰Ûªs basic genetic mechanism is just as complicated as cells found in humans, researchers can conduct experiments in a stage that human cell research will not reach for another 10 years.</p>
 
<p>‰ÛÏThe motor or origin of cancer is genetic instability. Control processes are inactivated and cells can‰Ûªt maintain their genetic makeup,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏBy investigating yeast at the basic level that is the same in all cells, we can see what happens when the genetic makeup is being challenged. Because yeast is such a convenient system, we can get results quickly and don‰Ûªt have many additional factors to consider like in human studies.‰Û</p>
 
<p>Dr. Siede said any organism, whether as simple as yeast or as complicated as the human cell, has to deal with external genotoxic stressors such as ultraviolet light, chemical agents and radiation in addition to the daily barrage of internal physical insults produced by normal cellular metabolism. Damage by genotoxins changes the chemical structure of DNA components, setting the stage for biological consequences such as cell death, cell mutation and the development of cancer. Dr. Siede said learning the process and points in the cell‰Ûªs life cycle where these changes occur will contribute to scientists‰Ûª understanding of how cancerous cells develop in humans.</p>
 
<p>Progress in the research by Dr. Siede and others in the field has shown a lot about the mechanisms related to yeast‰Ûªs reaction to DNA stressors, and now his research has evolved to look at how the cell regulates DNA repair.</p>
 
<p>One major topic of his research is regulation of DNA damage tolerance. ‰ÛÏCells have a way of tolerating the damage and delaying repair. That‰Ûªs okay for a simple cell like yeast ‰ÛÓ it‰Ûªs a way for them to just go on with life. However, in an organized tissue of human cells, the damage builds up until it puts cells at risk of not being able to do DNA repair. It doesn‰Ûªt make a lot of sense for cells to tolerate the damage, but they do.‰Û</p>
 
<p>The tolerance aspect is a new concept in the study of genotoxic damage, and it has researchers questioning how it fits into the human model. Dr. Siede said the current thinking is that regulation is a key for when it invokes the tolerance, for when the cell determines the benefit of tolerating damage is greater than the risk, but it is unclear at this point just when and why that happens.</p>
 
<p>Another area of interest concerns cell cycle regulation. As early as 1987, researchers realized that if one damages the DNA in cells, the cells will stop their cycle because they need time for repairing. Dr. Siede explained that it is at certain points in a cell‰Ûªs cycle progression, called checkpoints, that a cell is able to arrest its cycle in response to DNA damage. Such checkpoints are essential to preserve genetic stability. </p>
 
<p>Of concern is when a cell is not triggered at its checkpoint and is exposed to deleterious aspects of unrepaired DNA damage rather than stopping the cycle for repair. These checkpoints are frequently defective in tumor cells ‰ÛÓ but why? </p>
 
<p>‰ÛÏMany people think that is why they are cancer cells,‰Û Dr. Siede said, ‰ÛÏbecause of that defect in a very early step of a process that maintains genetic stability.‰Û </p>
 
<p>Another project related to his work in checkpoint regulation won him a RO1 level award ‰ÛÓ the best you can get ‰ÛÓ from the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Siede is using yeast to develop a short-term model for certain aspects of checkpoint activation that can be used for screening anti-cancer agents. </p>
 
<p>‰ÛÏAgents that activate the checkpoints in normal cells but not in cancer cells represent a window of opportunity for treating cancer, and agents that actually modify the checkpoint response are of considerable interest in cancer therapy,‰Û he said.</p>
 
<p>‰ÛÏThe chemical industry can provide many new agents for fighting cancer,‰Û Dr. Siede said, ‰ÛÏbut all have to be tested. In an early stage, yeast can be used for those tests.‰Û</p>
 
<p>Prior to his position at Emory University as an assistant professor in the Department of Radiation Oncology and with the Winship Cancer Institute, Dr. Siede was an instructor and research assistant professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. He received his doctorate degree in microbiology from the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany, before completing post-doctoral work in molecular biology at Stanford University School of Medicine.</p>
 
<p>Dr. Siede co-authored a textbook, <i>DNA Repair and Mutagenesis</i>, with mentor Errol Friedberg, MD, of UT Southwestern and Graham Walker, PhD, of MIT.</p>
 
<p>In addition to his research, Dr. Siede teaches courses in cell regulation and DNA repair for the health science center‰Ûªs Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.</p>
 
<p>‰ÛÏI came to the health science center for several reasons, but foremost because I see an opportunity to make a difference in an up-and-coming research institution. There are many benefits to being here. Good graduate students, the advantages of being at a smaller institution, friends I have in the area, the location of the campus in a world-class arts district ‰ÛÒ there were so many factors that made up my decision.‰Û </p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,183,7/1/03 0:00,HSC RESEARCHERS UNMASK SECRETS TO TICK-BORNE ILLNESSES,"<p>Hiding behind the reputation of its more famous cousin <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, the spirochete <i>Borrelia lonestari</i>has escaped the notice of researchers who study tick-borne illnesses. Until recently, that is. </p>
<p>Scientists at UNT Health Science Center have turned their attention to <i>B. lonestari</i>, which infects Lone Star ticks, and are developing a test to unmask its secrets. </p>
<p>For years, the scientific community has focused on <i>B. burgdorferi</i>, the pathogen known to cause Lyme disease, and its host, the deer tick. However, <i>B. lonestari </i>is now thought to cause a mysterious malady with Lyme-like symptoms that does not yield positive results with current Lyme diagnostic tests. If left untreated, either infection can lead to more serious ailments, including arthritis, nerve damage, heart problems and death.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏNothing is known about this pathogen carried by the Lone Star tick; it hasn‰Ûªt been cultured, has rarely had its DNA sequenced, and has never connected scientifically to the Lyme-like symptoms we suspect it of causing,‰Û said Phillip Williamson, PhD, a specialist in molecular genetics research and head of the Lyme Disease Laboratory at the health science center. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre changing all that.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Williamson is leading a team of researchers who are studying the Lone Star tick to find out more about the pathogen it carries, <i>B. lonestari</i>.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏUnder the microscope, the spirochetes look the same, but they‰Ûªre very different genetically,‰Û Dr. Williamson said. These genetic differences form the basis of the health science center‰Ûªs screening test for the pathogen.</p>
<p>In 1994, the Texas Department of Health collected more than 28,000 ticks throughout the state. They found that nearly 95 percent of them were Lone Star ticks. ‰ÛÏThis survey and our preliminary data indicate that Lone Star ticks should be viewed as a potential health risk to Texans,‰Û Dr. Williamson said.</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Administration, chaired by state Sen. Chris Harris, issued an interim report on the prevalence of tick-borne illnesses in Texas in 2000. This report recommended that the state develop a comprehensive diagnostic laboratory to facilitate the creation of a precise and effective diagnostic test for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. In 2001, the Texas legislature acted on the recommendations and established the laboratory at UNT Health Science Center. </p>
<p>Over the past 18 months, the team has been setting up the lab, collecting specimens and establishing partnerships to further its research and help develop the diagnostic test.</p>
<p>Health science center researchers are collaborating with scientists at the Tick-Borne Disease Laboratory at the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland to analyze samples from any soldiers who are bitten by a tick. The Army provides the ticks, and the health science center performs DNA sequencing on the samples. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe need the tick in order to find the pathogen it carries,‰Û Dr. Williamson said. ‰ÛÏWe now have a constant source of samples from diverse geographic locations.‰Û</p>
<p>Results are submitted to GenBank, the DNA sequence repository at the National Institutes of Health. ‰ÛÏGenBank contains the DNA sequences for any species,‰Û Dr. Williamson said. ‰ÛÏWe use it to double-check the quality of our sequences and to identify known genetic differences within the species.‰Û</p>
<p>Since its discovery, only 17 <i>B. lonestari </i>sequences have been published in GenBank. These sequences offer limited insight since many of them were obtained by generating multiple sequences from a single tick sample or a group of samples collected in the same area. When Dr. Williamson and Army entomologist Ellen Stromdahl, PhD, publish their sequences later this year, they will add 67 unique sequences to the database, and they are currently preparing another 80.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre not only increasing the number of sequences five-fold, but our samples come from 11 different states,‰Û Dr. Williamson said. ‰ÛÏAlthough some may think this species is named after the Lone Star State, we‰Ûªre documenting that it‰Ûªs a common parasite from the south-central United States to New England and the entire east coast. We‰Ûªve also shown that the species does not vary much, so a single test should work for ticks found in other parts of the country.‰Û</p>
<p>With little intra-specie variation, researchers can focus their efforts on developing a genetic test that quickly identifies specific species of pathogens and differentiates them from their cousins.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏOur goal is detecting Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses quickly and accurately,‰Û Dr. Williamson said. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve developed a very specific test for <i>B. lonestari </i> that will allow us to find out how prevalent this pathogen really is in Texas.‰Û</p>
<p>In the past year, health science center researchers have demonstrated that the tick is infected with the pathogen suspected of causing Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness, a disease with Lyme-like symptoms. Currently, they are trying to demonstrate that these ticks actually transmit the disease to humans.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve accumulated a tremendous amount of information on the organism, and we‰Ûªve used that information to make our test better,‰Û Dr. Williamson said. ‰ÛÏNow we need more clinical samples from recently infected people to demonstrate that the test has a clinical application and not just a scientific one.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Williamson, an assistant professor of pathology and anatomy, is also working with faculty from the health science center‰Ûªs School of Public Health and the biological sciences department at the University of North Texas in Denton to expand the scope of his research. The team is waiting to hear about possible NIH funding that would allow them to conduct a survey of the tick population in north Texas. </p>
<p>They plan to begin the project this winter by sending a questionnaire to physicians and veterinarians in an 11-county area surrounding Dallas and Fort Worth. Sam Atkinson, PhD, chair and professor, and Terry Gratton, DrPH, assistant professor, both of environmental and occupational health in the School of Public Health, will combine the results with a geographic information system (GIS) to pinpoint habitats where ticks infected with <i>B. lonestari </i>have been found. </p>
<p>UNT researchers will then collect samples from animals in those habitats, and Dr. Williamson would do full genetic analysis on those samples.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe process soon becomes a cycle where we use the samples to update the GIS model and use the GIS model to identify places to collect more samples,‰Û Dr. Williamson said. ‰ÛÏWe estimate that we‰Ûªll analyze more than 10,000 samples over two years.‰Û </p>
<p>The team would use the information they collect to influence public health policy and develop programs to educate and inform the public about the risks associated with tick bites. </p>
<p>Once it develops a test for Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses, the lab will expand its genetics research into other areas. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre developing our test to be flexible so that we can quickly adapt it to identify other pathogens to help with other emerging infectious diseases,‰Û Dr. Williamson said.</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,182,7/1/03 0:00,PROVING THE HEALING TOUCH OF MANIPULATION,"<p>During the influenza epidemic of 1918, patients treated by osteopathic physicians had a better chance of survival than the general population. According to statistics, the mortality rate from influenza cases treated by osteopaths was only 0.23 percent, compared to the national mortality rate of 12 to 15 percent. For flu cases further complicated by the development of pneumonia, the numbers were 10 percent compared to the national average of 25 percent.</p>
 
<p>The osteopathic medical profession often refers to that collection of case reports as key documentation that osteopathic manipulative therapy is viable in treating pulmonary disorders. Today, the practice of using osteopathic manipulative therapy, or OMT, to treat patients hospitalized with pneumonia has become the exception rather than the rule for the osteopathic medical community.</p>
 
<p>However, the 1918 study pre-dates the use of antibiotics to treat pneumonia and only in the past few years has the osteopathic medical profession taken on the challenge of showing the benefits of OMT as a complement to other treatments for pneumonia to the larger medical community, which is often skeptical about the benefits of OMT. </p>
 
<p>To build on favorable results yielded from earlier pilot studies, a two-year, multi-center clinical trial to determine osteopathic manipulative treatment‰Ûªs effect in the recovery of hospitalized pneumonia patients age 60 and older was launched in June by the national Osteopathic Research Center, housed at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.</p>
 
<p>What Donald Noll, DO, principal investigator, and a team of OMT specialists from five clinical sites across the nation hope to document on a large scale is further proof of earlier studies‰Ûª findings ‰ÛÓ and of the findings of thousands of osteopathic physicians throughout the decades who have used OMT to treat pulmonary disorders.</p>
 
<h4>Big Picture Progress</h4>
 
<p>The studies conducted by Dr. Noll and other researchers in the field have shown OMT‰Ûªs effectiveness in significantly shortening the length of hospital stay and decreasing the amount of antibiotics needed to treat pneumonia. The big picture for this trial, however, has more far-reaching effects than improved healthcare for the elderly.</p>
 
<p>The study is particularly significant because its $1.5 million in funding comes from a relatively new consortium of osteopathic foundations and other supportive organizations, including the Osteopathic Heritage Foundation of Ohio, the Brentwood Foundation of Ohio, the Foundation for Osteopathic Health Services of Maryland, the Muskegon General Osteopathic Foundation of Michigan, the Colorado Springs Osteopathic Foundation, the Quad City Osteopathic Foundation of Iowa, the Northwest Oklahoma Osteopathic Foundation and the Osteopathic Institute of the South in Georgia.</p>
 
<p>In 2001, the American Osteopathic Association, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine and the American Osteopathic Foundation created a national Osteopathic Research Center, aimed at fostering nationwide collaborative research in osteopathic manipulative medicine. The groups realized the profession must pool its resources to fund research that proves OMT principles valid, which would allow it to seek larger research grants from the National Institutes of Health and other funding sources.</p>
 
<p>The groups selected UNT Health Science Center from a field of six competing osteopathic medical schools to be the headquarters for the national center and provided $1.1 million over four years to fund research projects. John Crosby, JD, AOA and AOF executive director, said, ‰ÛÏUNT Health Science Center excelled in all aspects of the selection process, and they have the faculty, facility and financial resources available to support the ORC.‰Û</p>
 
<p>The Osteopathic Research Center plans multi-center studies, submits grants and facilitates the work of individual study sites. In its first year, the ORC submitted $6.8 million in grant applications and received $3.2 million in national research awards, including the original funding for the center.</p>
 
<p>‰ÛÏOne of the main goals of the ORC is to develop large, collaborative projects that link the power of all the colleges and hospitals of osteopathic medicine,‰Û said Scott Stoll, DO, PhD, director of the ORC. ‰ÛÏMulti-center studies allow schools to pool their resources, resulting in research studies with more statistical power.‰Û</p>
 
<p>During a recent visit by the External Advisory Committee, which is charged with monitoring the progress of the ORC, health science center leaders emphasized the importance of the ORC to both the institution and the osteopathic profession as a whole, reiterating the institution‰Ûªs support of the center. ‰ÛÏThis visit provided us an opportunity to discuss the ORC‰Ûªs progress and plan for the future,‰Û Crosby said. ‰ÛÏOverall, we‰Ûªre pleased with the ORC‰Ûªs development over the past year and look forward to seeing it progress in its efforts.‰Û</p>
 
<p>‰ÛÏProving the efficacy of OMT in large, scientifically controlled clinical studies could move it into generally accepted use for all mainstream medicine,‰Û Dr. Stoll said.</p>
 
<h4>Study Specifics</h4>
<p>‰ÛÏPneumonia is a major health problem, particularly in the elderly,‰Û said Dr. Noll, an associate professor and chair of internal medicine at Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine in Missouri. ‰ÛÏHospitalized elderly are an especially vulnerable population, with longer average hospital stays, higher hospitalization rates, more complications and higher mortality rates than the general adult population.‰Û</p>
 
<p>Specifically, the study will seek to document OMT‰Ûªs associated benefits related to decreased use of antibiotics, shorter hospital stays and better health outcomes, including reduced deaths resulting from pneumonia in elderly hospital patients.</p>
 
<p>Following strict clinical trial protocol, the subjects recruited for the study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: patients receiving osteopathic manipulative therapy by an OMT specialist in addition to the normal course of conventional treatment by attending physicians, a control group of patients receiving ‰ÛÏplacebo‰Û treatments by a specialist in addition to the conventional treatment, and a control group of patients receiving conventional care only.</p>
 
<p>The patients in the OMT and placebo treatment groups will receive the same care as the conventional care patients, but with additional treatments twice a day, seven days a week by an OMT specialist.</p>
 
<p>The study protocol for the first group utilizes the same manipulative treatment techniques used in the earlier studies, such as bilateral paraspinal muscle inhibition, bilateral rib raising, diaphragmatic myofascial release, condylar decompression, cervical soft tissue technique, and bilateral myofascial release to the anterior thoracic inlet and the thoracic lymphatic pump. These seemingly complicated manipulative treatments are administered while the patient is lying in bed and last for only about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
 
<p>Patients in the control group receiving placebo treatments are treated with a light touch that mimics OMT to the same area of the body, in the same order and for the same duration. The average physician contact time for the control touch group are approximately the same as that for the treatment group, allowing the investigators to measure the difference in benefits of OMT versus the benefits that touching a patient has on its own.</p>
 
<p>‰ÛÏThere is the possibility that touching the patient has its own effect,‰Û said Dr. Noll, ‰ÛÏwhich is separate from the effects of OMT. We want to measure both effects by having control touch and control no-touch groups.‰Û</p>
 
<p>Important to maintaining tight protocols for the study is the ability to keep attending physicians and house staff unaware of the patient group assignments. While aware of which patients are participating in the study, they are not told of the patients‰Ûª assignments. The patients‰Ûª charts include no information about the study treatments, and none of the examinations or treatments by the investigators is done in the presence of the house staff or attending physicians. Even the patients and their families are kept in the dark about their assignments.</p>
 
<p>Outcomes are quantified by measuring 1) the time until clinical stability of the patients‰Ûª blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation is reached; 2) improvements in the patients‰Ûª ability to eat and mental status; 3) the time until overall clinical stability; 4) changes in leukocytosis, or bacterial count, in the lungs; 5) mortality rate; 6) patient satisfaction; and 7) the rate of recovery.</p>
 
<p>The pneumonia trial involves five clinical sites, Mount Clemens General Hospital in Michigan; Kennedy Memorial Hospital at the University of Medicine and Dentistry School of Osteopathic Medicine in New Jersey; Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas, which is affiliated with UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine; Doctors Ohio Health Hospital; and Northeast Regional Medical Center; which is affiliated with Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine. </p>
 
<p>In addition to Dr. Noll and the ORC support team, each site will have a site research team of the principal investigator, site co-investigator and site research coordinator. The study began in June with training at the study sites by Dr. Noll. </p>
 
<h4>Ultimate Success</h4>
<p>The pinnacle for success of the pneumonia study and others conducted through the ORC, though, has more to do with overall acceptance of OMT as a viable medical treatment modality than with the particular outcomes of any one study. With research data to prove its effectiveness, use of OMT by physicians in various specialty areas, integration into patient care processes in hospitals, and coverage of the procedures by insurance companies could become common practice.</p>
 
<p>So, while the OMT specialists participating in the study are confident that their treatment will improve the care and recovery of a group of patients at a crucial point in their lives, they also know that this study could mean improved care and recovery for thousands, even millions, in the years to come.</p>
 
<p>‰ÛÏAny new treatment tool or method that proves effective can mean lower healthcare costs and, most importantly, the potential to relieve suffering,‰Û Dr. Noll said. ‰ÛÏShould the results of this study provide positive scientific evidence, OMT is in a unique position to be rapidly integrated into common clinical hospital-based practice</p>

<p>Knowing that healthy behaviors early in life can have lifelong benefits, the UNT Health Science Center is providing local families with information they can use to adopt a healthier lifestyle for their children. At the same time, researchers are finding ways to address the growing problem of early-onset diabetes and heart disease.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body fails to produce or use enough insulin. Historically, it was considered an adult disease, but more teen-agers are being diagnosed. A similar pattern is now being observed with youngsters‰Ûª having high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol levels, both risk factors for coronary heart disease. </p>
<p>One leading study researcher is Ximena Urrutia-Rojas, PhD, assistant professor in the School of Public Health at the health science center. She is working with John Menchaca, MD, a Fort Worth pediatrician.
 ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre trying to work with the whole family, not just focus on the child,‰Û Dr. Rojas says. ‰ÛÏMost likely, everyone in the household has similar eating and exercise habits. Together, we can find solutions that work for the whole family.‰Û </p>
<p>Other researchers working on the project are Walter McConathy, PhD, and Craig Spellman, DO, PhD, who are both associate professors in internal medicine, Andras Lacko, PhD, a professor in molecular biology, and Wendy Whittaker Wadley, MPH, research assistant. The research team is being assisted by master of public health student Naveed Ahmed, MBBS, and Ellie Kourosh, a dietician from the inaugural class of doctor of public health students.</p>
<p>In a survey of 1,056 local fifth-graders last year, researchers found that nearly a quarter of students surveyed were at high risk for developing diabetes according to American Diabetes Association criteria. The students were found to be at risk due to specific factors, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, or showing signs of <i>acanthosis nigricans</i>, a skin condition that can be an early sign of insulin problems. Family history of diabetes and being African-American or Latino also increased a child‰Ûªs risk of the disease.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to the survey, families whose children were identified at risk were offered free in-depth clinical exams for all their children. The screening also measures blood sugar levels and cardiovascular risk factors. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏFortunately, none of these children were diagnosed with actual Type 2 diabetes,‰Û Dr. McConathy says. ‰ÛÏBut the tests did show that these children remain at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We‰Ûªve found that this young population resembles adults in their cholesterol and blood sugar levels.‰Û </p>
<p>After the children‰Ûªs exams, the families discuss the test results with a clinician and learn specific ways to reduce their children‰Ûªs risk.</p>
<p>Recommendations can be as simple as watching less TV, playing outside more, and eating healthier foods and fewer sweets. Families who attend counseling sessions have exhibited greater success and are more involved with addressing the issue.</p>
<p>In addition to working with individual families, the health science center continues to work with the Fort Worth Independent School District to implement population-based interventions to decrease or at least slow weight problems and obesity in FWISD students.</p>
<p>This fall, the school district will launch new menus to encourage healthy eating habits among students. In addition, students from kindergarten to eighth grade will now have physical education as a required daily activity, thanks to a new state law.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThis project combines true service, comprehensive teaching, and high quality research,‰Û Dr. Rojas says. ‰ÛÏI hope that in the near future we will be able to say the health science center made a big contribution to the health of Fort Worth children.‰Û</p>

<p>Endothelin is usually linked to cardiovascular disease and hypertension, but health science center researchers have found that certain eye tissues can make it, too, and that the protein produces some important <p>actions in the eye that are unrelated to the vascular system. </p>
‰ÛÏWe are now looking at the role of endothelin in glaucoma,‰Û Dr. Yorio said. ‰ÛÏBased on our findings, we‰Ûªve filed a patent for a new type of drug that could treat glaucoma.‰Û </p>
<p>The National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health has funded the research since 1998. The NIH/NEI has recently awarded Dr. Yorio another $1,278,000 in funding for the project. Co-investigators are Ganesh Prasanna, PhD, and Raghu Krishnamoorthy, PhD, both research assistant professors in pharmacology and neuroscience. </p>

<p>A grant from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board Advanced Research Program provided seed funding for this research. This allowed the research team to collect preliminary data needed to successfully compete for the NIH/NEI grant. </p>
<p>The research team has received additional funding from Texas‰Ûª Advanced Technology Program to examine compounds that will prevent the production of endothelin, which may protect the optic nerve from damage.</p>
<p>Dr. Yorio credits graduate student Martha Stokely, who works in his laboratory, with the discovery that endothelin can produce pathological effects on the optic nerve. Using a model she developed, the research team was able to secure funds from a pharmaceutical company to study the neuroprotective actions of one of the company‰Ûªs drugs on the system. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThis could have implications for treatment of a number of neurodegenerative diseases besides glaucoma,‰Û Yorio said. </p>
<p>###</p>",,,,,179,11/1/02 0:00,PYRUVATE UPS HEART SURGERY RECOVERY ODDS,"<p>Investigators at the UNT Health Science Center are collaborating on a clinical research project that may hold the first major advance of its kind in more than a decade of heart disease research and treatment. </p>
<p>The new trial takes years of laboratory research by Robert Mallet, PhD, associate professor of integrative physiology, to the operating room where cardiac surgeon Albert Yurvati, DO, assistant professor of surgery, is testing its effectiveness in improving patient recovery after cardiac by-pass surgery.</p>
<p>Dr. Mallet has been investigating energy sources used by the heart during and following cardiac by-pass surgery for 15 years. He has discovered that one particular fuel source, the natural anti-oxidant pyruvate, is superior to other physiological fuels in providing a greater amount of energy to the heart following surgical cardiac arrest. </p>
<p>Dr. Mallett‰Ûªs work has already proven pyruvate‰Ûªs ability to bolster the effectiveness of drugs used during cardiac surgery to stimulate the heart‰Ûªs function, allowing surgeons to administer lower, safer doses of the drugs. That earlier study was taken to the clinical trial phase by surgeons in Germany.</p>
<p>Dr. Mallet explained that while the heart is stopped, it resembles a car that has run out of gas, and pyruvate is like a high-octane fuel. Surgeons performing by-pass surgery use a potassium-based solution called <i>cardioplegia </i>to cause the heart to stop beating during surgery. During surgical arrest, the natural anti-oxidants that work to prevent tissue damage caused by free radicals are depleted, leaving the heart vulnerable to oxidative injury. By supplying pyruvate, this oxidative damage may be reduced or eliminated, thus accelerating the recovery process, Dr. Mallet said. </p>
<p>Pyruvate has been added to the cardioplegia solution in 30 by-pass patients, and all of the patients have experienced improved and more rapid cardiac recovery following surgery, he said. The use of pyruvate is also associated with a 50 percent reduction in the amount of supplemental drugs typically necessary to help patients recover. </p>
<p>Additionally, protein analyses have provided evidence that pyruvate is helping to protect the heart from oxidative damage during surgery. No adverse side effects have been observed with the addition of pyruvate, and many patients‰Ûª hospital stay is a day less than typically required. </p>
<p>Dr. Mallet said that in addition to the health and quality of life benefits of this procedure for patients, it may actually be associated with cost savings due to a reduced need for recovery drugs and earlier patient release. ‰ÛÏThe cost of adding pyruvate to cardioplegia is miniscule in comparison to the cost-saving potential of this procedure,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>Surgeons may soon see similar benefits of pyruvate in other types of cardiac surgery and in treating cardiac trauma. Drs. Mallet and Yurvati have recently been awarded a $235,000 grant from the Osteopathic Heritage Foundation to expand the scope of their study. Dr. Mallet also has been awarded a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to conduct further pre-clinical studies with pyruvate.</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,178,8/1/02 0:00,STUDY SHOWS MEDICAID'S POSITIVE IMPACT,"<p>Health science center researchers have documented that eligibility for Medicaid has a significant, positive impact on the health of poor children.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s, Medicaid, one of the largest items in the federal budget, has been the primary means of financing health care services for poor children. On several occasions in the late1980s, the federal government expanded Medicaid financial guidelines so more of the nation‰Ûªs children would be eligible for the program.</p>
<p>Kristine Lykens, PhD, assistant professor of health policy at UNT Health Science Center, served as the primary author on a study investigating the link between the Medicaid expansion and the health of children enrolled in the program. The study found a statistically significant relationship between children‰Ûªs eligibility for Medicaid and their overall health. </p>
<p>Dr. Lykens said that while a great deal of research has been conducted on how the expansions affected children‰Ûªs access to health care, there has been little investigation into how they influenced the children‰Ûªs actual health. The only previous studies measured mortality rates, which is not the best way to accurately measure the impact of the Medicaid expansions on the state of the eligible children‰Ûªs health, she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Lykens and her collaborator, Paul A. Jargowsky, PhD, of the University of Texas at Dallas, used data that the National Center for Health Statistics in the Department of Health and Human Services collects in its annual surveys of randomly selected households in 48 states. The surveys ask questions about the health of one randomly selected child in the household. Drs. Lykens and Jargowsky used survey results from a four-year period between 1988 and 1991 and restricted their sample of data to children who were under 15 and eligible for Medicaid, based on household income.</p>
<p>The survey results included data on the number of acute illnesses, such as asthma and ear infections, a child had; the number of school days missed due to illness; how many days a child was confined to bed; and how long a child was restricted from normal activity during the two-week period before the respondents received the surveys. These are generally good indicators of how children are faring overall, and they demonstrate how illness impacts the children‰Ûªs daily lives, Dr. Lykens said. </p>
<p>Drs. Lykens and Jargowsky showed that in addition to improving access to health care, the Medicaid expansions did have a significant, positive effect on the eligible children‰Ûªs overall health. 
The study also showed that, while black and Hispanic children did benefit from the Medicaid expansions, those benefits were statistically more significant for white children. 
Dr. Lykens said this disparity in the findings might be attributed in part to a smaller sample of minorities in the households randomly surveyed by NCHS. </p>
<p>Drs. Lykens and Jargowsky also hypothesize that, due to the fact that many rural and inner city neighborhoods face a shortage of pediatricians, minorities may experience difficulties finding physicians in their area who accept Medicaid. Therefore, parents of children in those areas use the emergency room for the majority of their medical care, Dr. Lykens said. ‰ÛÏThis reduces the improvement in children‰Ûªs health because of a lack of continuity in their healthcare providers.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Lykens said Medicaid expansions ‰ÛÏadded more than a million children to the program during the period of the study.‰Û However, she continued, ‰ÛÏWe need to reduce the disparities, especially in access.‰Û She and Dr. Jargowsky recommend that more emphasis be placed on provider access, ensuring that children have physicians in their neighborhoods who accept Medicaid. They said this is especially important for minorities. 
The complete findings from this study are available in the spring 2002 issue of the <i>Journal of Policy Analysis and Management</i>.</p>
<p>Dr. Lykens said she plans to continue her investigation into the relationship between children‰Ûªs health and public programs with an examination of the Children‰Ûªs Health Insurance Program. CHIP, a federal program enacted two years ago, provides health insurance for children whose families do not qualify for Medicaid and lack private health insurance.</p>

<p>Dr. Lykens is a longtime researcher into health care policy and its effects. Before joining the health science center, she was a policy analyst for the Department of Health and Human Services in the Office of the Inspector General, where she evaluated the implementation of the CHIP program and the impact of HMOs on their beneficiaries. </p>

<p>The Federal Demonstration Project brings together federal agencies and research institutions in a combined effort to increase research productivity and decrease the administrative burden associated with federal funding. By addressing administrative and regulatory issues, the FDP is able to streamline and standardize procedures and processes for federally supported research and education and increase the amount of time spent on actual research.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏWhen the federal government is considering a new program, it first launches it as a demonstration project,‰Û explained Robert Gracy, PhD, associate vice president of research and biotechnology. ‰ÛÏOnly FDP members have the opportunity to participate in those pilot projects.‰Û</p>
<p>As a member, the health science center will be able to participate in field testing new federal programs and gain access to any potential funding associated with them. </p>
<p>Another benefit of membership will be increased recognition of the health science center as a research institution by other FDP members. The institution will also be able to offer input on the structure of new projects and have the opportunity to address excessive administrative requirements before they‰Ûªre finalized.</p>
<p> ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªll have direct influence on the final structure of programs and even their viability,‰Û Dr. Gracy said. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªll be included as a major player in the development of new programs.‰Û</p>
<p>As the first osteopathic medical school in the program, the health science center will also bring a fresh perspective to federal guidelines and grant applications. ‰ÛÏAs an osteopathic school, we‰Ûªll be able to address any exclusionary language or implications that place us at a disadvantage when a program is still in its pilot stages,‰Û Dr. Gracy said. ‰ÛÏAs a result, the playing field between allopathic and osteopathic medical schools should become more level when we‰Ûªre applying for federal research dollars.‰Û</p>
<p>FDP members also benefit from increased autonomy from federal funding agencies. ‰ÛÏThe federal government gives FDP institutions more authority to approve funding reallocations requested by principal investigators and handle some reports at the local level,‰Û Dr. Gracy said. </p>
<p>FDP has initiated a change from requiring federal prior approvals to allowing institutional approvals of such items as foreign travel and equipment purchases. It also allows participants to authorize prespending, approve no-cost extensions, and carry forward unobligated funds from one budget period to the next.</p>
<p>FDP began in 1986 in Florida and expanded in 1988 to become a national program. In 1996, the program further broadened the scope of its members with the initiation of its third phase. Now in Phase IV, FDP includes nearly 100 institutional members and 10 federal agencies, as well as some affiliate agencies. The Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable of the National Academy of Science serves as the program‰Ûªs neutral coordinator. </p>
<p>FDP Phase IV will formally begin with an inaugural meeting Sept. 12-13, 2002, at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>###</p>",,,,,176,11/1/02 0:00,HSC LEADS TEXAS LYME DISEASE RESEARCH,"<p>Diagnosing Lyme disease in its early stages is critical to successful treatment, yet no clear test for the disease exists. </p>
<p>Some researchers say Lyme disease may be confused with Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness, or STARI, a mysterious malady in Texas and other states south of Maryland. It causes the same type of rash, but patients with STARI typically respond well to antibiotics while those with confirmed Lyme disease may not. The two diseases confuse laboratories, leading to false test readings and misdiagnoses.</p>
<p>The situation is more complex in Texas because many areas where Lyme-like symptoms are reported do not contain high numbers of the type of deer tick that is usually infected with the pathogen that causes Lyme disease. Instead, a related pathogen carried by a different species of tick, the Lone Star tick, is more prevalent in these areas and is believed to be associated with the symptoms reported by patients. To date, little research has been done on the Lone Star tick as a carrier for Lyme and Lyme-like illnesses.</p>
<p>The Texas Legislature established a clinical genetics program at UNT Health Science Center in 2001 to address this problem. The program will focus on Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses.
The Senate Committee on Administration, chaired by Sen. Chris Harris, issued an interim report on the prevalence of tick-borne illnesses in Texas in November 2000. Among its findings, the committee recommended that the state develop a comprehensive diagnostic laboratory to facilitate the creation of a precise and effective diagnostic test for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. </p>
<p>Phillip Williamson, PhD, a specialist in molecular genetics research, heads the health science center‰Ûªs Lyme Disease Research Laboratory.</p>
<p>Dr. Williamson‰Ûªs research team will lead the state‰Ûªs effort to develop uniform testing of tick-borne illness, including Lyme disease. The researchers are developing a DNA-based test that will detect the DNA of the specific pathogen identified in the disease instead of testing for an immune response. They hope DNA testing will provide a faster diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment. </p>
<p>The first step for the team is to collect ticks, study the pathogens they carry and research clinical cases of Lyme-like diseases. They are also collecting clinical samples through collaborative efforts with the Texas Department of Health and medical practitioners treating patients suspected of having Lyme disease or its Texas counterpart.</p>
<p>The health science center will also launch an outreach program to develop statewide sources of clinical samples. Several physicians in Texas who treat patients for Lyme-like symptoms have expressed interest in participating in this study, Dr. Williamson said. </p>
<p>The DNA Identity Laboratory is also participating in studies with researchers in Maryland and Missouri, including Edwin Masters, MD, the physician who discovered STARI. These researchers will provide samples of ticks and from infected patients from the northeast United States areas where most cases of Lyme disease are reported.</p>
<p>Each year, about 16,000 Americans are diagnosed with Lyme disease. Because early symptoms are vague, an unknown number of patients are misdiagnosed or go untreated. Chronic Lyme disease can cause more serious ailments, including arthritis, nerve damage, heart problems and death.</p>
<p>###</p>",,,,,175,11/1/02 0:00,HSC TEAM STUDIES NEW TB THERAPIES,"<p>New data released from the national Tuberculosis Trials Consortium indicates that a regimen of medication therapy for active TB disease utilizing a new combination of drugs just once a week is a viable option to the current twice-weekly treatment regimen.</p>
<p>Stephen Weis, DO, an infectious disease specialist with the health science center‰Ûªs Physicians & Surgeons Medical Group and director of tuberculosis services at the Tarrant County Public Health Department, is principal investigator for the nationwide, multi-year clinical trial of new methods for the treatment and prevention of TB. His clinical team‰Ûªs participation as one of 23 sites in the consortium study is supported by a 10-year grant for more than $5 million from the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>A leading clinical researcher in TB, Dr. Weis is credited with initiating the first use of directly observed therapy for the control of tuberculosis in the United States. Directly observed therapy, or DOT, is now the recommended course of treatment for all patients with TB in the country and is being adopted by other areas of the world, many dealing with TB as an epidemic among their populations. His work with DOT resulted in a 70 to 80 percent decline in relapse rates among Tarrant County study subjects.</p>
<p>The data from the consortium‰Ûªs new study confirms that a once-weekly TB regimen, initiated after the first eight weeks of therapy, is a viable option for some patients being treated for active TB disease. The results were published in the Aug. 17 issue of the medical journal <i>The Lancet</i>. The new, less frequent regimen could improve patients‰Ûª compliance to therapy, helping to cure more TB patients and prevent further transmission, according to the report. </p>

<p>Investigators evaluated a regimen of once-weekly drug therapy using a new drug, rifapentine, in combination with the drug isoniazid during the continuation phase of therapy from the ninth to the 24th week of treatment. The new combination and regimen was evaluated in comparison to the current twice-weekly regimen of the drug rifampin combined with isoniazid. </p>
<p>More than 1,000 patients with active TB disease completed eight weeks of intensive TB therapy with the four frontline TB drugs ‰ÛÒ isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol ‰ÛÒ before being randomly assigned to one of two groups during the 16-week continuation phase of TB treatment. One trial group received isoniazid and rifapentine, the first new TB-specific drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 30 years, once a week. The other group received the standard therapy of twice-weekly isoniazid and rifampin. Patients included in the study were HIV-negative and had no signs of advanced tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The progress of both groups of patients was followed for two years to monitor the relapse or treatment failure rates. While the relapse rate in the once-weekly group was slightly higher, researchers found that for patients without lung cavities the once-a-week therapy was comparable in results and would be as successful as other currently approved treatment regimens. </p>
<p>TB is an infectious disease spread on airborne droplets, released from deep within the lungs when a TB sufferer coughs or sneezes. Unlike flu or measles ‰ÛÓ diseases that can be contracted just by walking through a room where the virus is airborne ‰ÛÓ the average TB infection results from long-term, constant exposure. People with compromised immune systems, substance abusers, people living in shelters or on the streets, those in poor living conditions and people who travel internationally are most likely at risk. After decades of decline and the lowest TB incidence rate in the world, the number of TB cases in the United States has escalated with the increase of these populations and their interaction with the general public.</p>
<p>Dr. Weis said participation in the consortium is crucial to local TB efforts. ‰ÛÏBy exploring new ideas and working with other investigators, we‰Ûªre on the cutting edge of research to diagnose, treat, and prevent TB,‰Û he said. </p>
<p>The World Health Organization has declared TB a global emergency and estimates that nearly two million people die each year from the contagious infection. Based on current trends, WHO estimates that one billion people could become infected with TB by 2020.</p>
<p>Dr. Weis said local efforts and those of the national consortium could avert the fulfillment of such dire prophecies. ‰ÛÏHopefully, we‰Ûªll be able to make some findings here that will be able to affect tuberculosis throughout the world, in addition to helping individuals here in Tarrant County.‰Û</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,174,11/1/02 0:00,CLINICAL TRIAL EVALUATES NEW ARTHRITIS THERAPY,"<p>UNT Health Science Center is participating in the world‰Ûªs largest arthritis clinical trial, which is evaluating a new investigational drug compound. TARGET, or Therapeutic Arthritis Research and Gastrointestinal Event Trial, will evaluate more than 18,000 patients worldwide during a 12-month period.</p>
<p>TARGET‰Ûªs primary objective is to examine the gastrointestinal safety of a new drug compound from Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. It will compare the investigational drug to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen and naproxen. It will also study the cardiovascular safety, tolerability and efficacy of all three drugs. </p>
<p>Novartis‰Ûª investigational drug is a new class of NSAIDs that selectively block the release of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). If left unblocked, the COX-2 enzyme triggers the release of hormone-like compounds, which cause inflammation and produces pain.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏTARGET is the first COX-2 inhibitor gastrointestinal safety trial where cardiovascular safety will be assessed as one of the pre-specified endpoints,‰Û said Bernard Rubin, DO, MPH, chief of rheumatology. </p>
<p>In previous clinical trials, researchers found that NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors have varying incidence rates of severe adverse reactions, such as heart attacks and gastrointestinal bleeding. What remains unclear is whether or not there is a true difference between the newer and older drugs in overall safety, Dr. Rubin said.
By examining the effects of the drug on the gastrointestinal system, researchers hope to find out if patients who use COX-2 inhibitors for their arthritis suffer from fewer peptic ulcers than those who use NSDAIDs for their pain relief. The study will also try to determine whether patients taking COX-2 inhibitors have fewer heart attacks than those taking NSAIDs. </p>
<p>Study participants will receive free study-related care during the year-long trial, including periodic physician office visits, study medication, lab tests and electrocardiograms. Participants must be 50 or older and experiencing symptoms of osteoarthritis for three months or longer.</p>
<p>TARGET will not be the largest arthritis clinical trial for long. Merck is preparing to launch an arthritis clinical trial of another new COX-2 inhibitor drug in a clinical trial of its own, enrolling approximately 25,000 patients worldwide. The health science center will be one of the sites for that trial as well. </p>

According to the Surgeon General‰Ûªs recent report, ‰ÛÏCall to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity,‰Û 13 percent of children aged 6 to 11 years and 14 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years were overweight or obese in 1999. That number has almost tripled in the last two decades. </p>
           <p> UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs School of Public Health is collaborating with the University of North Texas‰Ûª Department of Kinesiology, Health Promotion and Recreation and the Dallas Independent School District in an obesity research program called Project PATH (Participating and Training in Health). </p>
<p>Funded with a grant from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, Project PATH is aimed at increasing the proportion of high school students who engage in vigorous physical activity, reducing the proportion of obese and overweight students, and reducing cigarette smoking in that age group, while teaching graduate students how to deliver health promotion programs to underserved populations.</p>
<p>Hector Balcazar, PhD, chair of social and behavioral sciences, is coordinating the research in part due to his success with the program <i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n </i> (Health for Your Heart) in north Texas. That program was targeted at the area‰Ûªs fast-growing Hispanic population, which has a higher rate of overweight and obesity than any other racial group.</p>
<p> <i>Salud para su CorazÌ_n </i> is being tweaked by graduate students from the School of Public Health to fit into high school semesters and class schedules and will be a core piece of Project PATH. Most of the research will focus on North Dallas High School, which has a high percentage of Hispanic students.  </p>
<p>About 800 ninth graders will be involved with Project PATH. Coordinators will encourage a change in health behavior of these students through classroom materials and discussions, videos, diet, nutrition, and physical activity. The graduate students ‰ÛÒ three are bilingual ‰ÛÓ will work in the classrooms as teachers‰Ûª aides and will help coordinate extracurricular activities for the students. They will also serve as mentors ‰ÛÓ both for physical activity and for getting high school freshmen interested in careers in health and science. By starting with the ninth graders, the researchers hope to be able to track the effects of the health education throughout the participants‰Ûª high school years.</p>
         <p>‰ÛÏWe are trying to integrate it into the context of high school, so it will trigger interest in students to exercise and to do heart-healthy activities, which will ultimately improve their health,‰Û Dr. Balcazar said. 
The program also includes booklets, comic books and instructions in both English and Spanish to help make it culturally relevant to people whose primary language is Spanish. </p>
<p>Because the overweight and obese population is growing among adults ‰ÛÓ 61 percent of all adult Americans fall into the category ‰ÛÓ it is important for students to take what they learn home to be read by parents and grandparents, Dr. Balcazar said. The information might spur the whole family to eat healthier and exercise, which will contribute to a better lifestyle for many North Texans. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe are very excited about the opportunity the coordinating board has given us to impact the lifestyle of grade-school children,‰Û said Dr. James Morrow, professor of kinesiology, health promotion and recreation at the University of North Texas and principal investigator on Project PATH. ‰ÛÏWe look forward to working with our students and colleagues to help these students achieve healthy lifestyles and lifelong healthy habits.‰Û</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,172,8/1/02 0:00,NEI funds Wordinger‰Ûªs glaucoma research,"<p>Robert Wordinger, PhD, head of the division of cell biology and genetics and associate professor in the department of pathology and anatomy, has received a grant for $852,000 from the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health.
The title of his grant is ‰ÛÏGlaucoma, Neurotrophins, and the Human Lamina Cribrosa.‰Û The grant will fund the research project for the next three years.</p>
<p>People who suffer from glaucoma may have increased pressure within the eye. This pressure eventually damages the optic nerve, causing blindness. Dr. Wordinger will study the role of the growth factor neurotrophin and whether it helps protect optic nerve cells from the increased pressure. Most of the damage from glaucoma occurs within the lamina cribosa region of the optic nerve head, a framework of tissue at the back of the eye through which millions of retinal ganglion cell axons exit the eye and form the optic nerve.</p>
<p>Currently, glaucoma is treated three different ways, depending on the severity of the disease. Each treatment works to affect the constant flow of ocular fluid, called aqueous humor, into or out of the eye. It is the build up of this fluid that increases the pressure within the eye. The majority of patients use eye drops to decrease the flow into the eye, thus lowering the pressure. If eye drops are not effective, a patient may undergo laser surgery to increase the amount of fluid that can exit the eye. The third treatment, for patients with the most severe glaucoma, involves more intensive surgery to address the outflow of fluid.</p>
<p>Dr. Wordinger‰Ûªs research findings could eventually lead to new treatments that improve the drainage of ocular fluid without surgery or save retinal ganglion cells from dying.
‰ÛÏRight now, patients have to undergo surgery to increase the amount of fluid draining from the eye,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm hopeful that this research will help us keep the eye‰Ûªs natural drain clear by unclogging it, if you will.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Wordinger‰Ûªs research focuses on growth factors such as neurotrophins. He originally worked in the area of reproductive biology, but a family history of glaucoma sparked an interest in the disease. He has focused on this area of research for eight years.</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,171,8/1/02 0:00,"Researcher team explores alcohol, nicotine link","<p>The strong connection between smoking and drinking has long been noted by the public at large and documented by social scientists, public health experts and clinical researchers. Scientists in the department of pharmacology and neuroscience at UNT Health Science Center have been looking at the issue from the perspective of pharmacogenetics, or the role of genetics in modulating the actions of a drug. </p>
<p>The husband-wife research team of Christopher M. de Fiebre, PhD, assistant professor, and NancyEllen de Fiebre, senior research associate, both of pharmacology and neuroscience, has uncovered new evidence that supports the theory that common genetic factors influence sensitivity to both alcohol and nicotine. Their findings were recently published in the June issue of <i>Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research</i>. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism funded the study. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏNumerous studies in the last several decades have confirmed that drinking and smoking are positively correlated,‰Û Dr. de Fiebre said. ‰ÛÏNowhere is this association seen as clearly as in alcoholic populations. While the percentage of smokers in the general American population has decreased over the last several decades, the rate of smoking among alcoholics has remained at approximately 90 percent, a rate well above that seen in nonalcoholic populations.‰Û</p>
<p>Their work began with the knowledge that whether an individual develops alcoholism or becomes dependent on tobacco is mediated by both genetic and environmental factors. ‰ÛÏWe then hypothesized that common genetic factors were involved in modulating sensitivity to both alcohol and nicotine and this, in turn, influenced the development of the co-abuse of these two agents,‰Û he said.</p>

<p>In a laboratory model, they found that being highly sensitive to alcohol corresponded with a high level of sensitivity to nicotine on one of several measures of nicotine sensitivity examined. Similarly, being insensitive to alcohol corresponded with being insensitive to nicotine.</p>
<p> ‰ÛÏThe key finding of this study is that there appears to be a commonality in the genes that modulate the actions of both nicotine and alcohol,‰Û Dr. de Fiebre said. ‰ÛÏSome, but not all, of the genes that modulate sensitivity to alcohol are probably the same as some, but not all, of the genes that modulate sensitivity to nicotine. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏAlthough we do not currently know which genes are responsible for modulating the actions of these two drugs, we hypothesize that the overlap in genes controlling sensitivity to these two drugs may in part explain why smokers drink and drinkers smoke,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>The specific genes that might be responsible for modulating the actions of both alcohol and nicotine remain largely unknown, however, the de Fiebres hypothesize that the genes that encode receptors for nicotine may be involved, and they are examining this possibility.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏPerhaps surprisingly, many genes influence sensitivity to even simple responses to alcohol. It is very doubtful that there‰Ûªs one single gene that acts as a predictor of addiction,‰Û Dr. de Fiebre said. ‰ÛÏOur research is part of an effort to try to unlock the secrets to addiction. Ideally, we would like to identify all the genetic factors that affect a body‰Ûªs reaction to drugs of abuse, primarily those effects that are driving the addiction process.‰Û</p>
<p>Future studies that include both alcohol and nicotine may yield answers to questions that have remained unresolved when the two drugs have been studied singly.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏIf we can gain a better understanding of how co-abused drugs work together and decipher those genetic factors that modulate co-addiction, perhaps we can design more rational therapies to treat the problem,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>Although much of the de Fiebres‰Ûª work focuses on the effects of alcohol and nicotine, their research is not limited to the effects of those drugs.</p>
<p>As a ‰ÛÏnicotinic pharmacologist,‰Û Dr. de Fiebre studies nicotinic receptors, the sites in the brain at which nicotine acts, and tries to ascertain how these receptors contribute not only to addiction, but to other pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe studies published in <i>Alcoholism </i>are a small part of the puzzle that we are trying to solve ‰ÛÓ the role of nicotinic receptors in pathology,‰Û Dr. de Fiebre said. ‰ÛÏBy gaining a better understanding of how common genes modulate the actions of both alcohol and nicotine, we can start asking which genes are involved in the development of alcohol and nicotine co-addiction and then use this information to develop rational therapies for this form of polydrug addiction.‰Û </p>
<p>The de Fiebres are also interested in what role nicotinic receptors or nicotinic systems play in normal brain function. 
‰ÛÏClearly we don‰Ûªt have nicotinic receptors so that we can abuse tobacco products. These receptors exist because we have within us a specific chemical called acetylcholine that normally activates these receptors to do something essential for normal brain function,‰Û he said.</p>
<p>Research has suggested that one normal function of nicotinic receptors is to assist in keeping nerve cells healthy and alive. Because of this, the de Fiebre research team is also examining the role of nicotinic receptors in Alzheimer's disease or alcohol-induced brain cell death and whether nicotine or drugs that mimic some of the actions of nicotine might be useful in treating these disorders.</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,170,8/1/02 0:00,CLINICIANS ENCOURAGE THYROID TESTING FOR ELDERLY,"<p>Many people may blame their lack of energy, thinning hair, frequently feeling chilled, or poor memory on growing older; however, these are also symptoms of hypothyroidism, a common malady that affects more than five million people, mostly older women.</p>
<p>Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disease that causes the body‰Ûªs metabolism to slow down. It occurs when there is too little thyroid hormone in the blood. Other common symptoms in adults include depression, constipation, muscle cramps, drowsiness and slow heart rate. Some patients may also exhibit a husky voice and dry and coarse skin. </p>
<p>Recent research at UNT Health Science Center found that these symptoms alone are not enough to diagnose hypothyroidism. Geriatric patients with normal thyroid function and those with hypothyroidism both report many of the same symptoms during an initial comprehensive exam. Researchers found that a quarter of the patients in the study had been diagnosed with the condition but that nearly all reported some of the symptoms.</p>
<p>As a result, the clinicians now believe that the only way to accurately diagnose the condition is through routine screening of every new geriatric patient.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏOlder patients have many symptoms that could be ‰Û÷hypothyroidism symptoms,‰Ûª but may also be due to other illnesses and chronic diseases, or even normal aging,‰Û said Janice Knebl, DO, chief of geriatrics at UNT Health Science Center.  ‰ÛÏMost of our patients have symptoms that could be from hypothyroidism, so we routinely measure thyroid function as a diagnostic test.‰Û </p>
<p>Medicare pays for thyroid tests as a diagnostic tool when thyroid dysfunction is suspected, but doesn‰Ûªt pay for the tests to screen for thyroid dysfunction. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe need to consider paying for TSH as a screen since it is a prevalent condition in this patient population and is very treatable,‰Û Dr. Knebl said.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏRoutine screening of thyroid dysfunction is probably much less expensive than the medical costs of treating the complications associated with undiagnosed hypothyroidism,‰Û said Jennifer Weatherly, DO, who conducted the research.</p>
<p>Dr. Weatherly, a resident in family medicine, said that when left untreated, hypothyroidism can cause significant health problems in the elderly, primarily by aggravating cardiovascular disease. Patients with hypothyroidism also were significantly more likely to have a history of depression, anxiety and angina than those without the condition. </p>
<p>James Hall, PhD, also worked with Dr. Weatherly and Dr. Knebl on the research. 
Dr. Hall said that routine testing rules out other conditions so that ‰ÛÏwe can then initiate the optimal treatment for every patient.‰Û</p>
<p>Clinician researchers reviewed the charts of 140 new patients in the geriatric clinic in the department of internal medicine. This was the first research study to focus on an outpatient clinic population. Only two other studies have focused on hypothyroidism in the elderly, but looking at an outpatient clinic population provides new insight into the incidence of the disease, Dr. Weatherly said.</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,169,2/1/03 0:00,NIDA RENEWS RESEARCH GRANT STUDYING COCAINE ADDICTION,"<p>The National Institute for Drug Abuse has renewed its $2.8 million contract with Michael Forster, PhD, professor of pharmacology and neuroscience at UNT Health Science Center. The four-year contract provides funding for Dr. Forster to continue assessing experimental drugs that may have significant impact on the treatment of cocaine addiction. NIDA, a component of the National Institutes of Health, has funded Dr. Forster‰Ûªs assessment of potential cocaine treatment medications since 1992.</p>

<p>‰ÛÏAbuse of and dependence on cocaine remains a critical public health concern,‰Û Dr. Forster said. ‰ÛÏDevelopment of medications for preventing or treating both cocaine and methamphetamine dependence is the most compelling unattained goal of the NIDA Division of Treatment Research and Development. Currently, no effective pharmacotherapy exists to treat individuals dependent on these drugs.‰Û</p>
<p>Cocaine belongs to a class of drugs known as stimulants, which tend to give a temporary illusion of limitless power and energy but in the end leave the user feeling depressed, edgy and craving more. The drug has become more prevalent because it has become more affordable and available, especially in the form of ‰ÛÏcrack‰Û cocaine. Dr. Forster and his research team systematically evaluate chemical compounds for their individual pharmacological effects and their ability to alter the effects of cocaine.</p>

<p>Michael Gatch, PhD, research assistant professor of pharmacology and neuroscience, works with Dr. Forster on the project. Other members of the research team are postdoctoral research associates Scott Coleman, PhD, and Margaret Rutledge, PhD, research associate Cynthia Taylor, senior research assistants Bradley Youngblood and Carla Elsken, and research assistants Elva Flores and Meghan Selvig. Graduate students Craig Hilburn and Chauncey Daniels also contribute to the research efforts.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe evaluate about 300 compounds a year in the search for potentially effective ones,‰Û Dr. Gatch said. The ideal compound would have the same subjective effects as cocaine in the short run, but would block the stimulating effects cocaine causes and decrease the amount of cocaine used over the long term, he said.
Dr. Forster said finding effective compounds for treating cocaine dependence is complicated because it acts on multiple receptors in the body.</p>
<p>The health science center is one of only two sites in the country that uses laboratory models to evaluate the efficacy of the compounds before they enter the clinical trial phase, Dr. Forster said. After completing additional test phases, the evaluated compounds are sent outside the health science center for the clinical trial phase, he said.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre hard workers in a big program,‰Û Dr. Forster said. ‰ÛÏThere is essentially no incentive for private industry to develop drugs to help heroin or psychostimulant addicts. There‰Ûªs not much profit in it. The government is putting forth an effort similar to what private industries would do for a more marketable drug.‰Û</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,168,2/1/03 0:00,HSC RESEARCHERS INVESTIGATE NOVEL DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM,"<p>Researchers at UNT Health Science Center are investigating a more effective way to deliver anticancer medication to tumors.</p>
<p>Andras Lacko, PhD, professor of molecular biology and immunology, and Walter McConathy, PhD, associate professor of internal medicine, are investigating whether reconstituted high density lipoproteins (rHDL) can be used to transport anticancer medication directly to tumors. </p>
<p>Reconstituted HDL is a combination of anticancer medication and natural components found in HDL, typically referred to as the carrier of ‰ÛÏgood cholesterol.‰Û Fatty materials called lipids and a protein called apolipoprtein (A1) are taken from HDL and reassembled with anticancer medication into rHDL, which the researchers expect will act as a transport vehicle, delivering the medication directly to cancerous cells through a process called receptor binding, Dr. McConathy said.</p>
<p>Cancer cells contain pathways into the cell, called SRB-1 receptors, that recognize and interact with A1, the main protein in rHDL. 
Drs. McConathy and Lacko have shown in cellular models that the anticancer medication contained in rHDL is likely taken up via the cancer cell‰Ûªs SRB-1 receptors. ‰ÛÏThe core of the rHDL contains the cargo, or anticancer medication, and the cancer cell‰Ûªs receptors on the cell surface represent the dock where the cargo is unloaded,‰Û Dr. Lacko said. ‰ÛÏThe HDL particle is then released into the blood to resume its normal functions.‰Û</p>
<p>Drs. McConathy and Lacko suggest that the pathway through SRB-1 would also help combat a patient‰Ûªs resistance to anticancer drugs. ‰ÛÏResistance to anticancer drugs is a big problem, similar to antibiotic resistance,‰Û Dr. Lacko said. Cancer cells pump the medication back out of the cell to defend themselves against the anticancer drugs, he explained. </p>
<p>Since the type of contact with the surface of a cancer cell affects whether it will resist the medication, resistance may be reduced if contact with the wall of a cancer cell is altered. They theorize that using SRB-1 as a different pathway into the cell may bypass the usual mechanisms that pump drugs out of cancerous cells.
‰ÛÏBy using the SRB-1 pathway to deliver medicine to a tumor, we may be able to improve the effectiveness of anticancer drugs,‰Û Dr. McConathy said. They plan to focus on this possible benefit in future research.</p>
<p>Another benefit of rHDL is that it facilitates the solubility, or dissolvability, of cancer drugs, Dr. Lacko said. Solubility is important because most cancer drugs are administered intravenously. In most current preparations, substances called solubilizers must be mixed with the cancer medication to liquefy it before it can be injected into the bloodstream. Solubilizers are often toxic, leading to many of the unpleasant side effects of chemotherapy, Dr. McConathy said.</p>
<p>rHDL contains lipoprotein, a large complex molecule of lipids and proteins that naturally carries substances that are not ordinarily soluble, such as cholesterol or fat, Dr. Lacko said. The researchers theorize that because the anticancer medication would be carried by the lipoprotein in the rHDL complex, it would already be in a form that could navigate through the body without the need for solubilizers.</p>
<p>Drs. McConathy and Lacko have also shown in cellular models using the anticancer drug taxol that the rHDL complex is stable. ‰ÛÏIt can stay in the body longer in the rHDL complex, compared to the conventional methods of delivering cancer medication.‰Û</p>
<p>While the use of rHDL as a drug delivery mechanism is still in its early, developmental stages, Drs. McConathy and Lacko believe it shows great promise. ‰ÛÏWe believe this project has a practical application for patient care and a clear path to utilization,‰Û Dr. Lacko said. ‰ÛÏHopefully, this will progress quickly to a point where it can help patients.‰Û </p>
<p>Most cancer research takes 10 years or longer to reach that point, but Dr. Lacko hopes to see clinical trials of the rHDL delivery system in less than five years.
‰ÛÏWe hope this will have general applicability in treating cancer, but it‰Ûªs hard to imagine there won‰Ûªt be at least one or two types of tumors that will be very sensitive to this improved rHDL therapy,‰Û Dr. McConathy said.</p>
<p>Drs. McConathy and Lacko have been involved in lipoprotein research for more than 25 years and have applied for a patent on the rHDL drug delivery technology. In 2001, they launched Lipomedics Ltd. Co., a private venture that licensed the rights to the rHDL technology through the health science center.
They began their partnership in cancer research through their membership in the health science center‰Ûªs Institute for Cancer Research. The ICR encourages collaboration between researchers with different specializations and helps translate laboratory findings into clinical studies among patients, according to Kenneth Brunson, PhD, director of the institute.</p>
<p>Their research is funded primarily by the Breast Cancer Research Program at the Department of Defense and the Institute for Cancer Research. The James Winterringer Memorial Fund for Prostate Cancer Research also provided a donation that allowed them to purchase much needed laboratory equipment. For information on how to help Drs. Lacko and McConathy in the war against cancer, call 817-735-2113.</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,167,4/1/02 0:00,Researchers Unravel Protein‰Ûªs Secrets ,"<p>Neuroscientist Peter Koulen, PhD, at UNT Health Science Center, has spent years studying one specific protein to decipher its role within cells. 
As a result, he has defined how this protein is linked to a common genetic kidney disorder, identified a new class of proteins, and pointed the way to new theories on other diseases.</p>
<p>The first step in his research was identifying the location of the protein, an ion channel protein named Polycystin-2, in cells. Proteins are produced within cells, and most ion channel proteins then move to the cell surface. But this protein acts differently.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏMeasured at the molecular level, other individual ion channel proteins that are found at the same location inside cells as Polycystin-2, have very low activity, but at the cellular level, they are much more active,‰Û said Dr. Koulen, an assistant professor of pharmacology and neuroscience. ‰ÛÏThe discrepancy was hard to explain with the current thinking about their role. A new hypothesis had to be developed and tested.‰ÛAfter three years, he confirmed that Polycystin-2 forms a new class within a group of proteins known as intracellular calcium release channels. </p>
<p>These types of proteins are critical to nerve, muscle or epithelial cells that rely on changes in the calcium concentration inside cells to signal them to act. They work together to form regulated gates that allow ions to pass through the membranes of the cell, changing the composition of ions within the cell and triggering many different cell functions.</p>
<p>As an extension of his work, Dr. Koulen joined researchers from Yale University School of Medicine and the University of Heidelberg in Germany to study the protein‰Ûªs role in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a common genetic disorder. They knew the protein was encoded by the gene PKD-2 and that the disease was linked to a genetic mutation of the protein, but they wanted to define specifically how Polycystin-2 functions in an effort to identify the cause of ADPKD and possible treatments.</p>
<p>In the March issue of the international journal  <i>Nature Cell Biology</i>, the multinational research team showed that Polycystin-2 causes calcium to be released in the kidney‰Ûªs epithelial cells. They were able to explain that Polycystin-2 acts in concert with other intracellular calcium release channels and might be responsible for the discrepancy between their low activity observed at the single channel level and their high activity at the cellular level. In addition, they show that the genetic defect in ADPKD results in the loss of this calcium-signaling mechanism.</p>
<p>If Polycystin-2 mutates, it affects the highly specialized and complex epithelial cells by making them revert to a simpler stage and lose their ability to perform. These cells form protective linings around various parts of the body, including the heart, kidney and brain.</p>
<p>The resulting damage first strikes the kidneys. The epithelial cells there can no longer function and the lining they form may develop cysts, or fluid-filled pouches. As a person ages, these cysts grow and their kidneys begin to fail. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏADPKD affects more than one in 1,000 newborn babies,‰Û said Dr. Koulen. ‰ÛÏWhen patients are young, the damage is mild and often remains undetected, but many of them suffer renal failure as adults and require kidney transplants.‰Û</p>
<p>People who have inherited ADPKD often do not notice anything unusual until they are 30 to 40 years old. The first noticeable symptoms may include high blood pressure, back or side pain, an increase in the size of the abdomen, blood in the urine and frequent bladder or kidney infections. </p>
<p>Today, ultrasound is the most reliable, inexpensive and non-invasive way to diagnose ADPKD once cysts develop. An individual at risk cannot yet be diagnosed before symptoms appear; however, family members of people with ADPKD can undergo special blood tests, called gene linkage analysis, to find out if they also carry the mutated gene and are at risk for the disease. </p>
<p>The finding may open the doors to new theories on other diseases, screening tests and therapies. For example, a person with ADPKD may have other health problems that could be related to this protein mutation. 
According to the National Kidney Foundation, which provided initial funding for Dr. Koulen‰Ûªs research, ADPKD cysts are found primarily in the kidney but can also affect other organs, including the liver, pancreas, spleen and ovaries. Such ‰ÛÏoutpouchings‰Û may occur in the walls of the large intestine and in the walls of blood vessels in the brain, where they may cause aneurysms and strokes. They may also be found in the abdominal wall, causing hernias. In addition, the valves of the heart may be affected, becoming floppy and resulting in heart failure in some patients. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏIf this protein is unable to function, it may impact the nervous system, the brain, and other vital organs,‰Û Dr. Koulen said. ‰ÛÏWe are now working on ways to identify other health problems that could be traced to this mutation.‰Û Polycystin-2 could also provide a new target for the development of novel drugs to influence the calcium concentration inside cells, thus affecting their ability to function.</p>

<p>‰ÛÏIf we can find a way to control the gate formed by this channel protein, we could possibly shut down the signals that tell a cancerous cell to grow or a brain cell to die,‰Û Dr. Koulen explained. ‰ÛÏTo date there are limited numbers of useful drugs available that target intracellular channels, and they often affect many cell types, leading to undesired side effects. Novel drugs targeting Polycystin-2 with minimal side effects could be relevant for a variety of diseases.‰Û</p>
<p>Dr. Koulen is continuing his research at the health science center with funding from Texas‰Ûª Advanced Research Program.</p>

Researchers at UNT Health Science Center found that duration of international travel was an important factor in identifying the most common users of travel medicine services.</p>
<p>Their findings suggest that short-term travelers, those who spend six days or less outside the United States, are less likely to visit a travel medicine clinic before their trips. Those who take these short trips may also be the most frequent travelers, including business people, entertainers, politicians, tourists and flight crews. These travelers often do not visit a clinic for pretravel counseling and health care, or when they do visit a travel clinic, they don‰Ûªt allow enough time before departure for optimal care.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏShort-term travelers may not have adequate lead time to receive optimal counseling and health care prior to their trip,‰Û said John C. Licciardone, DO, professor of family medicine and director of the International Travel Medicine Clinic. ‰ÛÏA frequent short-term traveler may face even greater risks by not taking appropriate steps to prevent disease and protect their health while abroad.‰Û</p>
<p>The study included 1,078 patients who visited the International Travel Medicine Clinic at the health science center from May 1990 through June 1994. </p>
<p>The International Travel Medicine Clinic stocks a full line of vaccines for international travel and is a State of Texas-approved Yellow Fever Vaccination Center. In addition to providing basic travel medicine services, such as pre-travel counseling, vaccines and prescriptions, the clinic also offers laboratory testing, visa and work permit physicals, travel medicine seminars, and on-site corporate travel medicine services.

<p>Kimberly Fulda, a research associate in Family Medicine and a 2001 graduate, studied cases of Hepatitis A in Dallas County, in cooperation with the county‰Ûªs health department.
‰ÛÏWe found the incidence in Dallas County is 1.9 times higher than the United States average, but still lower than the Texas average,‰Û Fulda said. </p>
<p>The study, which looked at numbers in 1998 and 1999, found that the rate of Hepatitis A was 17.8 per 100,000 in the state of Texas, 16.4 per 100,000 in Dallas County and 8.6 per 100,000 nationwide.
The state‰Ûªs proximity to Mexico, where sanitary conditions involving food preparation are more lax, is partly responsible for the increase in incidence.</p>
<p>Hepatitis A is excreted in feces then transmitted in contaminated food and water. Like other forms of hepatitis, it damages the liver.</p>
<p>The study showed a dramatic jump in the Dallas County incidents of Hepatitis A in 1999, when it rose to 26.5 per 100,000 residents. Fulda said 150 cases were traced back to a single restaurant. Many of the patrons were 50 years old and older, skewing the numbers slightly for that year.One surprising finding is that rates of Hepatitis A are usually lowest among Asian populations, but the Dallas County rates were lowest among African-Americans. </p>

<p>Fulda, who plans eventually to pursue post-graduate studies in epidemiology, said she drew some personal observations from the study, as well.
She said it is not yet mandatory to receive Hepatitis A vaccines prior to entering school, and she believes future studies regarding this issue are necessary.
‰ÛÏPersonally, I think seroprevalence studies need to be performed,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏA lot more children have Hepatitis A, but because they are asymptomatic they are not treated, but they can still pass it on to their parents.‰Û</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,164,4/1/02 0:00,Cardiac Device Prototype In Development,"<p>Researchers at UNT Health Science Center have developed a prototype of a new tool for heart surgeons and cardiologists that would support a patient‰Ûªs circulation following heart surgery or heart failure more effectively than pumps currently in use. </p>
<p>After results are in from initial laboratory testing, the new device will proceed to clinical trials to obtain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>The ‰ÛÏEnhanced Intra-Aortic Balloon Assist Device‰Û is specifically designed to overcome limitations of current devices in maintaining aortic blood pressure at an adequate level. 
Currently, cardiologists or cardiac surgeons use regular intra-aortic balloon assist devices to reduce the heart‰Ûªs workload and improve flow of blood to a patient‰Ûªs brain, heart and other vital organs. These pumps may not provide adequate circulatory support for patients with severely diseased or injured hearts.</p>
<p>Fred Downey, PhD, and Xiaoming Bian, MD, PhD, of the health science center‰Ûªs Cardiovascular Research Institute, invented the new device to improve blood flow and provide circulatory support when pressures fall below those required by currently available pumps. The enhanced device adds an external pumping module that works in series with an internal pump in cases where conventional intra-aortic balloon pumps are unable to maintain adequate blood flow.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThis device has the potential to provide additional support for patients with failing hearts,‰Û said Dr. Downey, who has studied heart function and coronary circulation for more than 30 years. ‰ÛÏResults from our initial prototype testing and simulation studies have been very promising.‰Û</p>
<p>Further, Dr. Downey anticipates that the new device will be specified for most conditions that require circulatory support, so that its reserve pumping capacity will be available, even if the patient‰Ûªs aortic blood pressure is initially high enough to use a regular pump. </p>
<p>After the U.S. Patent Office approved the invention in February 2001, the health science center licensed exclusive worldwide rights to Cardiac Surgical Devices, Inc., a privately held start-up company based in Irvine, California. In exchange, the health science center acquired 20 percent of the company‰Ûªs outstanding stock.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, congestive heart failure is the single most frequent cause of hospitalization for people aged 65 years or older, and heart disease is the leading cause of premature, permanent disability among working adults. </p>
<p>The Cardiovascular Research Institute was established in 1995 as an Institute of Discovery of UNT Health Science Center. CRI is a multidisciplinary program designed to promote basic and clinical research, education, clinical practice, and community outreach programs in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>###</p>",,,,,163,2/1/03 0:00,HSC RESEARCHER INVESTIGATES CELL COMMUNICATION,"<p>Alakananda Basu, PhD, deputy director of the Institute for Cancer Research at UNT Health Science Center, investigates how cells communicate to better understand how cancer develops and learn to treat it more effectively. She hopes to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy by exploiting a cell‰Ûªs signaling, or communication, pathways.</p>

<p>To control growth, cells communicate with each other and their environment through a network of signaling systems. Through a process called signal transduction, cells receive signals that tell them when to divide and when to die, said Dr. Basu, who is also an associate professor of molecular biology and immunology.</p>
<p>Cell death, or apoptosis, is important because it removes unwanted or damaged cells from the body. Because too little cell death can lead to cancer, it plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer. Apoptosis can also influence the response of tumor cells to cancer therapy since most anticancer medication works by ultimately inducing cell death, Dr. Basu said. Understanding what controls it is an important step to developing more effective treatments. ‰ÛÏIn normal cases, there‰Ûªs a perfect balance between cell death and growth. With cancer, this balance is disrupted,‰Û she explained.</p>

<p>Dr. Basu‰Ûªs research focuses on protein kinase C (PKC), a critical signaling element regulating cell growth. PKC belongs to a family of related proteins with distinct roles in the body, and she has shown in breast cancer models that some members of the PKC family can disrupt the process of cell death. </p>
<p>Dr. Basu is investigating how PKC interacts with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in this process. TNF is a small protein, or cytokine, that influences cell communication.
‰ÛÏTNF regulates a wide variety of cellular functions,‰Û Dr. Basu said. ‰ÛÏIt is involved in cell growth and death, as well as cell differentiation, the process by which cells take on unique characteristics.‰Û It also plays an important role in immunosurveillance, the monitoring process the immune system uses to recognize and destroy cancer cells, she said. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏTNF begins the process of cell death by binding, or interacting, with receptors on the cell‰Ûªs surface,‰Û Dr. Basu explained. ‰ÛÏThis interaction triggers the activation of a family of killer proteins, or caspases, that are essential for the execution of cell death by apoptosis.‰Û She is trying to determine how PKC regulates the activation of caspases and whether it cooperates with other cellular signaling systems to inhibit apoptosis.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏBecause too little cell death can lead to the development and progression of cancer, an understanding of how PKC prevents cell death should allow researchers to develop ways to use signaling pathways to inhibit the development of cancer,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏThe ultimate goal is to exploit PKC signal transduction pathways to benefit cancer therapy.‰Û </p>
<p>Traditional forms of chemotherapy, such as drug therapy, have several disadvantages that limit their value, she said. When the concentration of chemotherapy drugs is increased to treat unresponsive tumors, the medication can become toxic. In addition, patients often develop resistance to anticancer drugs and traditional medications may not be equally effective on all types of cancer.</p>
<p>Dr. Basu has been using the anticancer drug cisplatin as a model. Cisplatin is used to treat several types of cancer, including ovarian, testicular, cervical and small cell lung cancers. It works by binding to the DNA and preventing cells from dividing, Dr. Basu said. </p>
<p>Ideally, chemotherapy strives to eradicate only cancer cells without affecting healthy cells; however, cisplatin and other anticancer drugs can also bind with the DNA of healthy cells, causing the medicine to become toxic.</p>
<p> ‰ÛÏFurthermore, when cancer cells become resistant to cisplatin, the PKC signal transduction pathway is compromised,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏI hope to determine how these changes in PKC influence the activation of caspases and contribute to drug resistance. That will allow us to develop strategies to circumvent resistance to cisplatin.‰Û  
In addition to investigating how to combat resistance, Dr. Basu is also working to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy. She has shown that cisplatin can more effectively kill cancer cells when combined with agents that affect the PKC signal transduction pathway, such as a marine compound called bryostatin 1. </p>
<p>Clinical trials have begun for bryostatin 1, which targets PKC. When used alone, bryostatin 1 had limited success, however, Dr. Basu has shown that when used in small amounts in conjunction with cisplatin, it substantially improved the ability of cisplatin to kill cervical cancer cells.
‰ÛÏPKC regulators such as bryostatin 1 can regulate cell death by influencing the activity of the killer proteins, or caspases, which are activated by substances that damage DNA, such as anticancer medication,‰Û she explained. As a result of her research, the National Institutes of Health has begun clinical trials studying bryostatin 1 and cisplatin. ‰ÛÏRegulation of PKC by bryostatin 1 is complex, and a thorough understanding of how PKC regulates cell death is important to use bryostatin 1 effectively for cancer therapy,‰Û Dr. Basu said.  </p>

<p>Currently, her laboratory is trying to determine what steps leading to cell death occur following cisplatin-induced DNA damage. Dr. Basu is also studying how the PKC signal transduction pathway regulates how sensitive cells are to cisplatin.</p>
<p>While she uses cisplatin as a model drug, Dr. Basu expects her research will also be applicable to other drugs and disorders. When the processes regulating cell death malfunction, other diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and heart disease, can result, she said. This makes understanding how cell death works important to the treatment of many other diseases. </p>
<p>Dr. Basu‰Ûªs projects on TNF and PKC, ‰ÛÏTumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling in breast cancer‰Û and ‰ÛÏSignal transduction and cell death regulation,‰Û are both funded by the National Institutes of Health. </p>
<p>Prior to joining the health science center, Dr. Basu was an assistant professor in the department of pharmacology at the University of Pittsburgh, where she also served as a member of the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. She earned a bachelor‰Ûªs in chemistry and a master‰Ûªs in biochemistry from the University of Calcutta in India and earned a doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Pittsburgh.</p>

Making sure a scientist has the right number of subjects to ensure the testing results are valid, and making sure the subjects are the right ones, can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>Karan Singh, PhD, chair of biostatistics, is hoping to make the process a little smoother. The School of Public Health has created a Center for Biostatistical Consulting to assist scientists in their research. The center is primarily focused on helping investigators in the fields of public health and biomedical sciences, Singh said.<p>
<p> ‰ÛÏBiostatistics, which includes design, data management and analysis of research studies, came to the forefront during the last three decades when the National Institutes of Health realized the field played an important role in designing and conducting sound scientific studies,‰Û Dr. Singh said.</p>
<p> ‰ÛÏThe question is how many subjects do you need in a study ‰ÛÒ that is where the center comes in. If other people want to repeat what you have done [to test the study validity], they need to see the method of choosing subjects. It is justified through biostatistics,‰Û he said.<p>
<p>For example, if researchers wanted to survey Texans about their health attitudes, the center could provide biostatistical consulting  to ensure that they were surveying a representative sample of the whole state, Dr. Singh said.<p>
<p> ‰ÛÏThe CBC can assist researchers in designing and conducting studies of the highest quality,‰Û he said. ‰ÛÏIn doing so, we will play a role in enhancing scientific literature in public health, biomedical sciences and health care delivery.‰Û</p>
<p>The CBC includes faculty with expertise in pre-clinical, clinical and observational trial design and analysis; data management, data monitoring and interim analysis; and evaluation of accumulating evidence of safety and efficacy. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs a win-win situation,‰Û Dr. Singh said. ‰ÛÏWe can help the investigators with their research, and the experience can help our students as they seek jobs in pharmaceutical companies, local governments and hospitals.‰Û</p>

<p>The DNA Identity Lab at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth developed the database over the past two years and started accepting DNA samples Jan. 1, 2003. Its staff of forensic geneticists will use a direct link to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to expand the search beyond Texas' borders.</p>
<p>Nearly 100 sheriffs, police chiefs, FBI agents, medical examiners, DPS officers gatherer at the health science center March 21 to learn more about the database, receive free DNA collection kits, and tour UNTHSC's DNA lab facilities.</p>
<p>The lab's forensic experts will first focus on cases involving children. They will eventually help in a variety of missing persons cases, including cases involving kidnapped children, runaways, the physically or mentally disabled, and those missing after a catastrophe.</p>
<p>The health science center is working closely with the Texas Department of Public Safety and its Missing Persons Clearinghouse to raise awareness of the Texas DNA database. </p>
<p>""In Texas alone, 70,000 people are reported missing each year, and 90 percent of them are under 18,"" said Heidi Fischer, program specialist with the clearinghouse. ""Many of these cases are closed relatively quickly, but some remain open for years.""</p>
<p>Fischer said the Texas DNA database offers the clearinghouse a new avenue to solve open cases that are beyond the scope of such traditional identification methods as fingerprints or dental records. When detectives have only skeletal remains or fragments of bone, they must turn to DNA testing. Cases with only the smallest fragments of materials like strands of hair or samples in bad condition, the more specialized mitochondrial DNA testing is the only option.</p>
<p>The health science center's DNA lab is one of only 17 facilities in North America capable of conducting mitochondrial DNA analysis, said Art Eisenberg, PhD, director of the DNA Identity Lab at the health science center. </p>
<p>""As the database and facility grow, the hope and success of identifying missing family members will grow as well. We could expand our DNA services beyond Texas' borders and become one of the nation's regional hubs for the collection and analysis of missing persons DNA data,"" Dr Eisenberg said.</p>

<p>Dr. Caffrey, professor of integrative physiology and director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute at the health science center, received the award for his efforts to increase the pool of minority researchers.</p>
<p>Minority Access is a non-profit educational organization that supports individuals, institutions, government agencies and corporations of all kinds to diversify their campuses and work sites by improving recruitment, retention and enhancement of minorities. Minority Access works with the National Institutes of Health to identify institutional and individual role models for their efforts fostering the development of researchers from minority and disadvantaged communities, particularly in the biomedical sciences.</p>
<p>Dr. Caffrey has helped develop elementary, high school, college, graduate and professional programs to improve minority participation in science and medicine. He has been involved in mentoring more than 300 minority students at the health science center.</p>
<p>""Dr. Caffrey has over 20 years experience seeking out minority students and bringing them into his lab,"" said Robert Kaman, JD, PhD, assistant dean and director of outreach for UNTHSC's Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. </p>
<p>UNT Health Science Center conducts extensive kindergarten through college programs where students can gain information about the biomedical sciences and experience in research. These outreach programs aim to increase the numbers of under-represented and disadvantaged students entering graduate programs in the biomedical sciences. Each summer, participating students receive hands-on experience in an actual lab atmosphere under the guidance of graduate students and faculty researchers.</p>
<p>Dr. Caffrey said, ""a dedicated team approach to our programs is what really makes them work."" He said the outreach programs use a variety of strategies to try to increase the number of scientists from minority and disadvantaged communities. ""A lot of prospective students are unaware of all the channels that are available for obtaining a graduate education in the biomedical sciences.""  </p> 
<p>These and similar programs have resulted in a student body with about 20 percent under-represented minorities in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and 30 percent in the School of Public Health, Dr. Kaman said.</p> 
<p>""We're moving toward a more equitable distribution reflective of the population in Fort Worth and roughly Texas,"" he said. </p>
<p>Dr. Caffrey's award is further recognition of the health science center's ongoing efforts to encourage more students to enter science-related careers.</p>
<p>In 2001, Minority Access named the health science center one of its role model institutions, and the National Science Foundation honored it with the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. 
Last year, the health science center received a $1.3 million grant from the National Science Foundation to place its graduate students into high school biology classrooms and provide local science teachers with additional development opportunities. The grant seeks to increase the number of high school students who pursue a career in the biomedical sciences. </p>

<p>FORT WORTH, Texas - With millions of Americans speaking a language other than English at home, a limited ability to speak English can make it difficult for health care providers and their patients to communicate and may affect the overall quality of care.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of this issue, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has launched an $18.5 million national program to test innovative ways of providing medical interpretation to Latino patients in the hopes of achieving better health outcomes.</p>
<p>The foundation has selected the School of Public Health at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth as one of the program's 10 demonstration sites across the United States.</p>
<p>As a result, the health science center has received a $150,000 grant to develop strategies to address the issue of cross-cultural communications in health care. Once the planning phase is completed next year, the health science center may receive another $850,000 to implement the program. </p>
<p>The grant was awarded through the Hablamos Juntos Program administered by the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute located at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, CA.</p> 
<p>The program will be part of the new Texas Institute for Hispanic Health at the health science center. Other components of the institute are the Center for Cross-Cultural and Community Health and the Training Center for Spanish-Speaking Public Health Professionals. The institute takes advantage of a unique feature of the School of Public Health: about a third of the faculty speaks Spanish fluently.</p>
<p>&quot;We recognize that better communication between patients and their health care providers can enhance health care,&quot; said Fernando TreviÌ±o, PhD, MPH, dean of the School of Public Health and executive director of the Texas Institute for Hispanic Health. &quot;We want to develop ways to improve patient-provider communication today and lay the groundwork so that the situation in the future is even better.&quot;</p>
<p>Through the RWJF grant, the health science center will work with a diverse group of community partners, including Planned Parenthood of North Texas, Inc. and Tarrant County Mental Health/Mental Retardation.</p>
<p>Other partners are the family medicine clinics operated by the health science 
 center's Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, Tarrant County Public Health 
 Department, JPS Health Center -Diamond Hill, and Osteopathic Health Systems 
 of Texas. Alianza Comunitaria of Tarrant County and Salud para su Corazon of 
 North Texas, two programs that focus on educating the Latino community about 
 cardiovascular disease, will also be integrally involved.</p>
<p>These community and provider partners will help with collecting baseline data, developing strategies and making recommendations for the program.</p>
<p>Eventually, the health science center may be able expand its graduate courses to public health students, offer continuing education courses to health providers, and work with its partners to minimize cross-cultural communication barriers.</p> 
<p>&quot;During this first year, we'll develop and test linguistically and culturally appropriate health intervention strategies for Latino families,&quot; said Hector Balcazar, PhD, chair of social and behavioral sciences. &quot;Our goal is to establish a self-sustainable health care translation and interpretation training program and create a model that other organizations can replicate.&quot;</p>
<p>The foundation received 178 letters of intent responding to its initial announcement of the program. From that, it selected 23 organizations to submit full proposals. The 10 funded recipients were chosen from this pool.</p>
<p>""Our activities will dovetail nicely with the mission of the Texas Health Disparities Task Force to help eliminate inequities in health care for the multicultural and disadvantaged communities of Texas,"" Dr. TreviÌ±o said.</p>
<p>Dr. TreviÌ±o, one of nine appointees to the task force, said that Latinos are Texas' fastest-growing population, but are underserved and burdened with a high occurrence of certain diseases. They are more likely to have diabetes, more likely to be obese, more likely to die from heart disease than any other cause, and less likely to control their blood pressure.</p>
<p>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, based in Princeton, NJ, is the nation's largest philanthropy devoted exclusively to health and health care. It concentrates its grantmaking in four goal areas: to assure that all Americans have access to basic health care at reasonable cost; to improve care and support for people with chronic health conditions; to promote healthy communities and lifestyles; and to reduce the personal, social and economic harm caused by substance abuse - tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs.</p>

The centerpiece of the Imaging and Research Center will be an advanced computed tomography scanning system that performs ultra-fast non-invasive total body scans. The scanning system will have higher resolutions and faster scanning speeds than CT scanners now in use.

Congresswoman Kay Granger presented the health science center with a check from the Health Resources and Services Administration. The $492,230 in federal funding will support the purchase of the scanning system, with the remainder provided by state and private funds. The estimated total cost of the system is $2.5 million.

Physicians at the health science center will use the technology to aid in diagnosing diseases such as heart disease and cancer before symptoms appear in patients while researchers will use it to study the mechanisms of disease pathology.

""Our mission as an academic medical center focuses on primary care and preventive medicine. We provide high-touch medical care with high-tech tools,"" said Ronald Blanck, DO, health science center president.
UNT Health Science Center will work with the HealthView Center for Preventive Medicine, a California-based scanning center that originated the ""body scan"" and has become a leader in the CT scanning industry, on the project.

The HealthView scanner uses a significantly faster CT scanner with proprietary software (AngioCAT ‰ã¢) to rapidly scan the torso, resulting in stop-action 3-D views of the patient's beating heart, breathing lungs, and other organs.  By looking at this cross-section of a patient's body, doctors use this non-invasive test to detect health problems, including heart disease and cancer, in their earliest stages.

HealthView is now conducting clinical trials on Volume AngioCAT ‰ã¢, the next generation of imaging technology that will enable a total body ultra-high resolution scan in just seconds. 

""The HealthView scanning system changes the paradigm of medical care from reactive diagnoses and treatment to pre-symptomatic diagnosis and finding diseases in their earliest stages,"" said Harvey Eisenberg, MD, founder of HealthView and inventor of the AngioCAT ‰ã¢ software. 

""The absence of symptoms does not indicate the absence of disease,"" Dr. Blanck said. ""This technology allows us to detect diseases and begin treatment earlier. We'll also counsel patients who wish to modify their lifestyles to hopefully prevent them from developing diseases such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes.""

Health science center researchers will also use the Volume AngioCAT ‰ã¢ technology to examine physiological changes caused by cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease and other diseases.  

The Imaging and Research Center will be located in the health science center's new Biotechnology Center and Public Health Building. Construction is set to begin in November, with an estimated opening of late 2003.",,,,,130,8/9/02 0:00,UNT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER WELCOMES FUTURE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS,"The University of North Texas Health Science Center faculty will welcome its newest class of students at the annual Convocation and White Coat Ceremony.

This is the ninth year the health science center has received the award. 

The award is given annually to institutions that have at least 25 percent of the graduating class enter a family practice residency program. The health science center has been the sole recipient of this award four times in the last nine years, including this year.

This year, 34 percent of graduates from the health science center entered a family practice residency program. 

""Most of the physicians in rural communities are approaching or are past retirement age.  The increased need for family physicians becomes more critical because family physicians provide the full spectrum of patient care, from delivering babies to caring for children, adults and elders, in both the hospital and physician's office,"" Samuel T.

<p>The Council on Education for Public Health recently awarded a five-year accreditation to the School of Public Health at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. The five-year term is the longest a new school can receive.</p>
<p>In 1992, a steering committee of community leaders and health professionals proposed establishing a public health school in north Texas to train highly qualified individuals in the areas of public health practice and research.</p>
<p>The health science center then launched a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree program in 1995. Enrollment in the MPH program quickly exceeded initial expectations, with more than 100 students enrolled within three years. U.S. News & World Report soon ranked the degree program among the top 20 in community health in the country.</p>
<p>In 1999, a full School of Public Health was established, and a doctoral program was added.</p>
<p>This fall, the school will set a new enrollment record, with more than 220 students studying in its MPH program. Another 36 doctoral students will be working toward a doctorate of public health (DrPH) degree. Construction will also begin on a $27.5 million building to house both the growing school and the biotechnology research programs at the health science center.</p>
<p>With an accredited School of Public Health, UNT Health Science Center joins an elite group of institutions that includes Harvard, Johns Hopkins and Yale universities. In Texas, the University of Texas and Texas A&M Health Sciences Center have accredited graduate schools of public health.</p>
<p>UNT Health Science Center is now eligible to compete for research funding only offered to accredited institutions and is better positioned to recruit students and faculty. Graduates also benefit from the additional credibility associated with studying at an accredited institution.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏAccreditation means that outside reviewers have found our educational and research programs to be among the best in the country,‰Û said Fernando TreviÌ±o, MPH, PhD, dean of the School of Public Health.</p>
<p>To be accredited, an institution must offer master‰Ûªs degrees in all five disciplines of public health: epidemiology, biostatistics, health management and policy, environmental and occupational health, and social and behavioral sciences. It must also offer a doctoral degree in at least one of the disciplines. The School of Public Health exceeds this criterion by offering doctoral degrees in four of the disciplines.
Accreditation by CEPH allows for entrance into the Association of Schools of Public Health, a national organization that lobbies on behalf of public health.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe most significant impact is for students and graduates to qualify for jobs, fellowships and grants that require graduates from an accredited university,‰Û said Pat Evans, executive director of CEPH. ‰ÛÏCertain federal funds for grants that are available are tied to membership in the Association of Schools of Public Health, which requires the CEPH accreditation.‰Û</p>
<p>The accreditation comes at a time when public health is at the forefront of policy-making decisions. Concerns about the threat of bioterrorism have grown since Sept. 11, causing many local governments to add epidemiologists and other professionals to augment public health departments. Public health‰Ûªs message of prevention is also critical to addressing an emerging epidemic of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, that are associated with obesity, lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating habits, Dr. TreviÌ±o said.
‰ÛÏThis accreditation is recognition of the great work going on in the School of Public Health,‰Û said Ronald Blanck, DO, president of UNT Health Science Center. ‰ÛÏIt is the basis for even greater accomplishments as public health is more and more seen as the solution to the problems we face in our current way of doing health care.‰Û</p>

<p>Jackson will begin working in the UNT System offices, located in the Gateway Center on the UNT Denton campus, on August 21. However, he will not be vested with the formal authority of the position of chancellor until September 1, the day after current Chancellor Alfred Hurley officially steps down.</p> 

<p>The UNT Regents, acting as a search selection committee, selected Jackson from a diverse pool of candidates recommended by an advisory committee comprising students, faculty and staff of the system's component institutions and community representatives.</p>

<p>Announcing Jackson's appointment and the approval of his three-year employment contract, UNT Regents Chair Bobby Ray said, ""What a great day this is. We've met an important milestone in our system's history by appointing Lee Jackson as our new chancellor.</p> 

<p>""Jackson is a widely respected leader in Texas who brings a unique background to our system. He is a pacesetter who has worked to develop solutions for some of our region's most pressing challenges. He will build on the momentum of 20 years of great leadership established by Dr. Hurley. We expect Jackson will us his own dynamic leadership to bring about changes in our system that will take us to new levels of prominence in the region and state.""</p>

<p>As UNT System chancellor, Jackson will work to enhance the collective and individual futures of the system's institutions (the University of North Texas at Denton, the UNT Health Science Center at Fort Worth, the UNT System Center at Dallas and the future University of North Texas at Dallas) through building external relationships while overseeing the chief executive officer of each institution. In addition, he will focus on statewide and nationwide issues and how they relate to the UNT System.</p> 

<p>""I look forward to helping this board and the entire UNT family achieve the very high goals that have been set for this system. Dr. Hurley has left a tremendous legacy of accomplishment. He has been the undisputed catalyst for UNT's steady rise in stature and scope. It is a real honor for me to be able to take the baton of UNT leadership,"" Jackson said. ""While it's too early for me to discuss or assess any specific changes, I do see five broad priorities that I will use as guidelines to help set the tone for the development of the full potential of this young and growing system.""</p>

<p>The priorities that will be the initial focus of Jackson's chancellorship are: developing the full potential of the UNT System; helping to create a clearer and more visible identity for the system; enhancing the quality of programs, teaching and research at the three system institutions; promoting diversity through the system; and strengthening the financial base at all system institutions.</p>

<p>On July 3, the regents named Jackson as the sole finalist for the chancellor post.</p>

<p>Today's confirmation satisfies the Texas legal requirement for an interim period of at least 21 days between the selection of a finalist and the naming of a new chancellor.</p>

<p>The process was set in motion in January when Hurley announced his plans to step after 22 years with the university and the UNT System. He was both university president and system chancellor from 1982 until 2000 and he became the system's first full-time chancellor in October of 2000.</p> 

<p>Jackson has served as Dallas County Judge, the county's chief elected official, since 1987. As county judge, he has been responsible for regional advances in transportation, and has been an advocate for advances in public education, juvenile justice, workforce development, information technology, employee benefits and energy management.</p> 

<p>He is recognized as a regional leader in the area of transportation, having formed in 1991 the Dallas Regional Mobility Coalition, which advocates for transportation funding and oversees major transportation projects. He is the past chair of the Texas Conference of Urban Counties and is a member of the Regional Transportation Council and the Partners in Mobility Executive Board.

<p>The Council on Education for Public Health recently awarded a five-year accreditation to the School of Public Health at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. The five-year term is the longest a new school can receive.</p>
<p>In 1992, a steering committee of community leaders and health professionals proposed establishing a public health school in north Texas to train highly qualified individuals in the areas of public health practice and research.</p>
<p>The health science center then launched a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree program in 1995. Enrollment in the MPH program quickly exceeded initial expectations, with more than 100 students enrolled within three years. U.S. News & World Report soon ranked the degree program among the top 20 in community health in the country.</p>
<p>In 1999, a full School of Public Health was established, and a doctoral program was added.</p>
<p>This fall, the school will set a new enrollment record, with more than 220 students studying in its MPH program. Another 36 doctoral students will be working toward a doctorate of public health (DrPH) degree. Construction will also begin on a $27.5 million building to house both the growing school and the biotechnology research programs at the health science center.</p>
<p>With an accredited School of Public Health, UNT Health Science Center joins an elite group of institutions that includes Harvard, Johns Hopkins and Yale universities. In Texas, the University of Texas and Texas A&M Health Sciences Center have accredited graduate schools of public health.</p>
<p>UNT Health Science Center is now eligible to compete for research funding only offered to accredited institutions and is better positioned to recruit students and faculty. Graduates also benefit from the additional credibility associated with studying at an accredited institution.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏAccreditation means that outside reviewers have found our educational and research programs to be among the best in the country,‰Û said Fernando TreviÌ±o, MPH, PhD, dean of the School of Public Health.</p>
<p>To be accredited, an institution must offer master‰Ûªs degrees in all five disciplines of public health: epidemiology, biostatistics, health management and policy, environmental and occupational health, and social and behavioral sciences. It must also offer a doctoral degree in at least one of the disciplines. The School of Public Health exceeds this criterion by offering doctoral degrees in four of the disciplines.
Accreditation by CEPH allows for entrance into the Association of Schools of Public Health, a national organization that lobbies on behalf of public health.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe most significant impact is for students and graduates to qualify for jobs, fellowships and grants that require graduates from an accredited university,‰Û said Pat Evans, executive director of CEPH. ‰ÛÏCertain federal funds for grants that are available are tied to membership in the Association of Schools of Public Health, which requires the CEPH accreditation.‰Û</p>
<p>The accreditation comes at a time when public health is at the forefront of policy-making decisions. Concerns about the threat of bioterrorism have grown since Sept. 11, causing many local governments to add epidemiologists and other professionals to augment public health departments. Public health‰Ûªs message of prevention is also critical to addressing an emerging epidemic of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, that are associated with obesity, lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating habits, Dr. TreviÌ±o said.
‰ÛÏThis accreditation is recognition of the great work going on in the School of Public Health,‰Û said Ronald Blanck, DO, president of UNT Health Science Center. ‰ÛÏIt is the basis for even greater accomplishments as public health is more and more seen as the solution to the problems we face in our current way of doing health care.‰Û</p>

(DSWOP) has donated $1.2 million, the single largest gift in its history, to the University of North Texas Health Science Center to create an endowed chair in clinical geriatrics.</p>
<p>The endowment is intended to serve as a permanent catalyst for expanded clinical geriatric services to older adults and their caregivers in North Texas. In addition, it allows the health science center to provide expert training and mentoring in geriatrics for osteopathic medical students, residents in training, and geriatric fellows.</p> 
<p>A non-profit organization, DSWOP was established with proceeds from the 1983 sale of Stevens Park Osteopathic Hospital. It has since distributed over $11 million in grants to more than 150 different organizations.</p>
<p>‰ÛÏDSWOP continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to osteopathic medicine and UNT Health Science Center,‰Û said Joseph LaManna, D.O., DSWOP chairman. ‰ÛÏWith this gift, we‰Ûªve more than doubled the amount of support we‰Ûªve provided to the health science center over the years.‰Û</p>
<p>Previous grants from DSWOP to UNT Health Science Center totaled $1.187 million. DSWOP has provided the primary funding for the Continuing Medical Education office since 1985, a total of $980,000. In 1992, it also established a loan/scholarship program for senior medical students. To date, 11 medical students have participated in the program.</p>
<p>The endowed chair in clinical geriatrics is the first among all osteopathic medical schools. It further cements the health science center‰Ûªs commitment to improving the care provided to the growing population of those over age 65.  The center was among the first in the country to offer specialized medical training in geriatric care and conduct research into aging issues.</p> 
<p>UNT Health Science Center was the first medical school in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to establish a geriatric fellowship program so that physicians could receive advanced training in caring for elderly patients.</p>

If confirmed by the board later this month, Jackson will become the system's third chancellor. </p>

<p>The selection of Jackson completes a nationwide search begun in January of this year, following Dr. Alfred F. Hurley's announcement of plans to step down on August 31. Today's announcement begins a minimum 21-day interim period required by law before the board votes to officially appoint Jackson to the position. </p>

<p>Jackson has served as Dallas County Judge, the county's chief elected official, since 1987. As county judge, he has been responsible for regional advances in transportation, and has been an advocate for advances in public education, juvenile justice, workforce development, information technology, employee benefits and energy management. </p>

<p>""Judge Jackson's experience and high-profile leadership in the North Texas region are a perfect fit for our system, which is the only university system whose primary mission is to serve this region,"" says UNT System Board of Regents Chair Bobby Ray. ""His experience in the legislature, interest in education, and knowledge of regional, state and national issues will help to advance all components of our system, including the future UNT at Dallas."" </p>

<p>The UNT Board of Regents selected Jackson from a diverse pool of candidates recommended by an advisory committee comprising students, faculty and staff of the system's component institutions and community representatives. The board served as the search selection committee. Korn/Ferry International, an executive search firm, aided both committees in the search process. </p>

<p>The board has not set a confirmation date. </p>

<p>Jackson is recognized as a regional leader in the area of transportation, having formed in 1991 the Dallas Regional Mobility Coalition, which advocates for transportation funding and oversees major transportation projects. He is the past chair of the Texas Conference of Urban Counties and is a member of the Regional Transportation Council and the Partners in Mobility Executive Board. Jackson was instrumental in the creation of the North Texas Tollway Authority in 1997. </p>

<p>Jackson represented Dallas County in the Texas House of Representatives from 1976 to 1986, where he chaired the Business and Commerce Committee and was a member of the Public Education Committee. He was named one of the Ten Best Legislators by Texas Monthly magazine in 1983. D Magazine named Jackson a Legislative All-Star in 1981 and Dallas' Best Public Official in 1996.</p>

In a report released today, a 22-member expert panel convened by the National Quality Forum (NQF) identifies 10 priority actions that should be taken to improve the quality of healthcare for minority patients.</p>

<p>Improving Healthcare Quality for Minority Patients summarizes the proceedings of an NQF workshop sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund of New York.  The expert panel concluded that undertaking a small number of specific steps holds the promise for significantly improving the healthcare quality provided to racial and ethnic minority populations. </p> 

<p>‰ÛÏA system for systematically measuring and reporting the quality of healthcare is needed for everyone in America, but special attention needs to be directed towards addressing the disparities in the quality of healthcare for minority patients,‰Û said Kenneth W. Kizer, MD, MPH, President and CEO of the NQF.  ‰ÛÏHealthcare quality in the United States must rise to both a higher and more equitable level than currently exists.‰Û</p>

<p>""Developing quality of care data to document health care disparities is a priority of the Commonwealth Fund's program to improve quality of care for underserved populations,"" said Karen Scott Collins, MD, vice president at the Fund. ""The NQF's leadership in developing this action plan is an important step towards eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare.""</p>

<p>""We focused on the critical issue of how best to measure the quality of healthcare being provided to ethnic and racial minorities in the United States,‰Û said Fernando Trevino, PhD, MPH, Dean of the School of Public Health at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.  ‰ÛÏWe will never eliminate the rampant disparities that exist among our populations if we do not find a way to deliver high quality and efficient healthcare and preventive services to all.‰Û</p>

<p>""As we increase the collection of race/ethnicity and language data, we will be able to better monitor how health services are utilized and improve culturally competent and language services and quality to minority patients,"" said Elena Rios, MD, President of the National Hispanic Medical Association.</p>

<p>Approximately one in three Americans belongs to a racial or ethnic minority group.  Healthcare quality measurement and reporting strategies that do not address the health needs of minority patients neglect a significant and growing portion of the U.S. population.  The consequences of this neglect are further exacerbated because minorities often shoulder a disproportionate share of poor healthcare quality even when they have access to the healthcare system.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li> African Americans with colorectal cancer are treated less aggressively than white Americans of similar socioeconomic levels.</li>
<li> Hispanics, Asian American/Pacific Islanders, and African Americans receive specialty cardiovascular care compared to each other and to white Americans.</li>
<li> Minority cancer patients were less likely to have access to beneficial pain management.</li>
<li> Pneumonia and influenza are among the leading causes of deaths in minority patients, but African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans American Indian/Alaska Natives are vaccinated less often for these conditions than white Americans.</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these and other healthcare quality disparities, the NQF experts recommend that providers, consumers, purchasers, researchers, policymakers and regulators take the following 10 priority actions:</p>

<p>1. Adopt the specific goal of eliminating disparities</p>

<p>2. Analyze existing healthcare quality measures to fully quantify the magnitude of minority healthcare disparities and refine the measure sets to reflect priorities for improving healthcare quality for minority patients</p>

<p>3. Develop new measures that focus on areas in which racial and ethnic minorities bear a disproportionate burden of disease or poor healthcare quality</p>

<p>4. Adopt and utilize a standardized set of cross-cutting quality measures (e.g., pain management, availability of support services, and cultural competency)</p>

<p>5. Establish healthcare quality standards around population-based goals</p>

<p>6. Increase and sustain federal support to improve services and research to improve healthcare quality for minority patients</p>

<p>7. Adopt federal policies that specifically promote standardized classification and collection of race and ethnicity data in healthcare settings</p>

<p>8. As has been done for the U.S. Census, build support and awareness among the public and providers on the importance of race and ethnicity data collection to improving healthcare quality for minority populations</p>

<p>9. Engage the many disparate consumer audiences in the drive to improve healthcare quality </p>

<p>10. Use community-based intermediaries to develop and disseminate healthcare quality information to minority consumers</p>

<p>‰ÛÏWe have documented for years that disparities exist in healthcare access, healthcare quality, and health outcomes for minority patients,‰Û said Kizer.  ‰ÛÏWhat is needed now is increased resolve and commitment by all healthcare industry stakeholders ‰ÛÒ providers, purchasers, consumers, researchers ‰ÛÒ to implement the report‰Ûªs recommendations.‰Û</p>

Established as a unique public-private partnership, the NQF has broad participation from all sectors of the healthcare industry.</p>

",,,,,120,5/29/02 0:00,UNT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER LEADS TEXAS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP UNIFORM TEST FOR LYME DISEASE,"<p>FORT WORTH, Texas‰ÛÓDiagnosing Lyme Disease in its early stages is critical to successful treatment, yet no clear test for the disease exists. Physicians must run a series of tests, which rule out other diseases and eventually point to Lyme Disease as the diagnosis.</p>
<p>In Texas, the situation is more complex because many areas where Lyme-like symptoms are reported do not contain high numbers of the typical deer tick infected with the pathogen that causes classic Lyme Disease. Instead, a related pathogen carried by a different species of tick (the Lone Star tick) is more prevalent in these areas and is believed to be associated with the ""Lyme-like"" symptoms reported by patients. To date, little research has been done on the Lone Star tick as a vector for Lyme and Lyme-like illnesses.</p>
<p>That‰Ûªs why the Texas Legislature established a clinical genetics program at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth last year. The program will first focus on Lyme Disease and other tick-borne illnesses.</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Administration, chaired by Senator Chris Harris, issued an interim report on the prevalence of tick-borne illnesses in Texas in November 2000.</p> 
<p>Among its findings, the committee recommended the state develop a comprehensive diagnostic laboratory to facilitate the creation of a precise and effective diagnostic test for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. The 77th Legislature acted on the recommendations and appropriated funds for the laboratory at UNT Health Science Center. </p>
<p>Now, the health science center is leading the state's effort to develop uniform testing of tick-borne illness, including Lyme Disease. Its researchers are developing a DNA-based test that hopefully will provide a speedier diagnosis and allow treatment to start earlier. Instead of testing for an immune response, it will detect the DNA of the specific pathogen that causes the disease.
</p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, UNT Health Science Center must first collect ticks, study the pathogens they carry and research clinical cases of Lyme-like disease.</p>
<p>Through its DNA Identity Laboratory, the health science center is collecting clinical samples through collaborative efforts with the Texas Department of Health and medical practitioners treating patients suspected of having Lyme or its Texas counterpart.</p>
<p>The health science center will also launch an outreach program concerning tick-borne vectors to develop statewide sources of clinical samples. Several physicians in Texas who are presently treating patients for Lyme-like symptoms have expressed interest in participating in this study.</p> 
<p>The DNA Identity Laboratory is also participating in studies with researchers in New England who will provide clinical and tick samples from areas where traditional Lyme Disease is endemic.
</p>
<p>Each year, about 16,000 Americans are diagnosed with the disease. Because early symptoms are vague, an unknown number of patients are misdiagnosed or go untreated. Chronic Lyme Disease can cause more serious ailments, such as arthritis, nerve damage, heart problems, and death.</p>

This is the second time the clinic has been recognized for providing top quality care for area diabetics.</P> 
<P>To be recognized by the program, physicians must demonstrate that they meet or exceed its high standards for patient care, including eye exams, blood pressure tests, and nutrition therapy, among others. When patients with diabetes receive quality care as outlined by these measures, they are less likely to suffer complications such as heart attacks, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and amputations.</P> 
<p>Craig Spellman, Ph.D., D.O., a diabetologist, is the clinic‰Ûªs medical director. He is joined by Stephen Weis, D.O., a board-certified endocrinologist, and Michael Clearfield, D.O., an internal medicine specialist. They all practice with the health science center‰Ûªs Physicians & Surgeons Medical Group, one of the largest group practices in North Texas.</p> 
<p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve made a commitment to provide excellent diabetes care,‰Û said Dr. Spellman. ‰ÛÏWe offer a full-spectrum program that recognizes all aspects of diabetes control.  It‰Ûªs more than monitoring a patient‰Ûªs blood sugar levels. Diabetes requires perfect control of sugars, cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, and above all, patient education on why tests are done and what they mean.‰Û</p>
<p>The comprehensive program includes clinical care, patient education and research activities.  Enisa Arslanagic, M.D., serves as the research and clinical coordinator for the Diabetes Clinic. A team of certified diabetes educators complements the medical care in the clinic. Educators Joice Carter, R.D., C.D.E., Sue Wiggers, R.N., C.D.E., and Craig Bennett, R.Ph., focus on patient education activities. The clinic also participates in major clinical trials to evaluate new diabetes therapies.</p> 
<p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre committed to the concept that patients must actively participate in controlling their own diabetes and its complications,‰Û Dr. Spellman said. ‰ÛÏDiabetics must be proactive. The days are gone where a physician simply tells a patient what to do. Our patient education program has been so successful because we encourage our patients to take control of their diabetes through proper nutrition, regular exercise, and ongoing awareness of how their day-to-day activities affect their health.‰Û</p>
<p>The ‰ÛÏProvider Recognition Program‰Û first recognized the health science center‰Ûªs Diabetes Clinic in 1998 with an initial three-year certification. The clinic will now hold Recognition status for another three years until 2004.</p> 
<p>The Diabetes Clinic evaluates patients who may have diabetes, monitors and educates newly diagnosed diabetes patients about managing the disease, and provides long-term care for diabetic patients of any age. Treatment is available for all diabetic conditions and complications.</p> 
<p>Diabetes is a serious disease that affects the body‰Ûªs ability to produce or respond properly to insulin, a hormone that allows blood sugar to enter the cells of the body and be used for energy. An estimated 16 million Americans have diabetes. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and it has no cure.</p>

This is the second time the clinic has been recognized for providing top quality care for area diabetics.</P> 
<P>To be recognized by the program, physicians must demonstrate that they meet or exceed its high standards for patient care, including eye exams, blood pressure tests, and nutrition therapy, among others. When patients with diabetes receive quality care as outlined by these measures, they are less likely to suffer complications such as heart attacks, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and amputations.</P> 
<p>Craig Spellman, Ph.D., D.O., a diabetologist, is the clinic‰Ûªs medical director. He is joined by Stephen Weis, D.O., a board-certified endocrinologist, and Michael Clearfield, D.O., an internal medicine specialist. They all practice with the health science center‰Ûªs Physicians & Surgeons Medical Group, one of the largest group practices in North Texas.</p> 
<p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve made a commitment to provide excellent diabetes care,‰Û said Dr. Spellman. ‰ÛÏWe offer a full-spectrum program that recognizes all aspects of diabetes control.  It‰Ûªs more than monitoring a patient‰Ûªs blood sugar levels. Diabetes requires perfect control of sugars, cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, and above all, patient education on why tests are done and what they mean.‰Û</p>
<p>The comprehensive program includes clinical care, patient education and research activities.  Enisa Arslanagic, M.D., serves as the research and clinical coordinator for the Diabetes Clinic. A team of certified diabetes educators complements the medical care in the clinic. Educators Joice Carter, R.D., C.D.E., Sue Wiggers, R.N., C.D.E., and Craig Bennett, R.Ph., focus on patient education activities. The clinic also participates in major clinical trials to evaluate new diabetes therapies.</p> 
<p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre committed to the concept that patients must actively participate in controlling their own diabetes and its complications,‰Û Dr. Spellman said. ‰ÛÏDiabetics must be proactive. The days are gone where a physician simply tells a patient what to do. Our patient education program has been so successful because we encourage our patients to take control of their diabetes through proper nutrition, regular exercise, and ongoing awareness of how their day-to-day activities affect their health.‰Û</p>
<p>The ‰ÛÏProvider Recognition Program‰Û first recognized the health science center‰Ûªs Diabetes Clinic in 1998 with an initial three-year certification. The clinic will now hold Recognition status for another three years until 2004.</p> 
<p>The Diabetes Clinic evaluates patients who may have diabetes, monitors and educates newly diagnosed diabetes patients about managing the disease, and provides long-term care for diabetic patients of any age. Treatment is available for all diabetic conditions and complications.</p> 
<p>Diabetes is a serious disease that affects the body‰Ûªs ability to produce or respond properly to insulin, a hormone that allows blood sugar to enter the cells of the body and be used for energy. An estimated 16 million Americans have diabetes. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and it has no cure.</p> 
<p>Physicians recognized by the Provider Recognition Program are listed on the ADA‰Ûªs website at www.diabetes.org/recognition. For more information about the Diabetes Clinic, please call 817-735-2660. </p>

In 2001, he received the International Achievement Award for Science and Medicine from the Worlds Affairs Council of Greater Fort Worth.  He has published over 200 research papers and book chapters and holds several patents in biotechnology. </p>
",,,,,97,1/25/02 0:00,UNT System Chancellor Hurley announces plans to step down August 31,"<p>DENTON (UNT), Texas åÊåÊUniversity of North Texas System Chancellor Alfred F. Hurley today announced his plans to step down on August 31 ‰ÛÓ the day he will complete what he describes as 22 ‰ÛÏhappy‰Û years with the university and the UNT System.</p>

<p>When he departs, Hurley, 73, will have served as the UNT System‰Ûªs chief executive officer for more than 20 years. </p>

<p>In remarks to members of the UNT System community, Hurley said, ‰ÛÏI feel the time has come to seek new challenges and pass the UNT System baton to another leader. My hope is that my successor will be an individual who will continue to lead the system to top-tier status ‰ÛÓ where the visions for our campuses are aimed.‰Û</p>

<p>UNT System Board of Regents Chairman Bobby Ray said, ‰ÛÏDr. Hurley helped steer UNT and the UNT System to new levels of achievement. Thanks in large measure to his leadership and determination, the UNT System and its institutions are stronger than ever and are well positioned to rise to new heights of excellence. He is an acknowledged champion for all issues that support quality higher education.</p>

<p>‰ÛÏUnder Dr. Hurley‰Ûªs guidance,‰Û Ray said, ‰ÛÏthe system‰Ûªs flagship institution, the University of North Texas, gained recognition as the largest and most comprehensive university in the dynamic North Texas region. The UNT System became one of the six recognized university systems in Texas. The Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine grew, adding new schools and departments to become the UNT Health Science Center at Fort Worth. And the Texas House and Senate unanimously passed a bill that establishes the University of North Texas at Dallas ‰ÛÓ which will become the first public university in the city of Dallas.‰Û</p>

<p>Hurley said, ‰ÛÏThe search for my successor will begin immediately with the aim of finding a new chancellor for the UNT System by August 31. Although my current contract expires on that date, I have assured the regents that I will do all I can to facilitate a smooth transition and to serve until the search is successfully concluded, if it takes longer than expected.‰Û</p>

<p>Hurley joined the university as vice president for administrative affairs on September 1, 1980. Less than 17 months after his arrival, in February 1982, he became UNT‰Ûªs 12th president and the second chancellor of the informal UNT System. He held the university presidency longer than any other chief executive in UNT‰Ûªs history. </p>

<p>In September 2000, the regents voted to separate the offices of system chancellor and university president. As a result in October of that year, Hurley became the system‰Ûªs first full-time chancellor.</p>

<p>Hurley is known as a modest man who always shares the credit for two decades of progress during his chancellorship and presidency with his wife, Joanna, and others.</p>

<p>‰ÛÏJoanna and I know full well that our exceptionally long stay can be attributed to the efforts of so many people who gave their best. Together we accomplished a great deal,‰Û Hurley said.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many credit Hurley as a major factor in the rise of the university and the system to educational leadership in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and North Texas region.</p>

<p>In a September 2000 editorial, The Dallas Morning News spotlighted Hurley as an ‰ÛÏunsung hero of higher education‰Û and cited the ‰ÛÏpivotal‰Û role he has played for the North Texas region. ‰ÛÏWhile other universities in this area have struggled at times to establish their roles, the University of North Texas has charged full speed ahead,‰Û it said. </p>

<p>The wide-ranging respect for Hurley‰Ûªs leadership makes it difficult for some to believe that presiding at UNT has been his second career. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1950 as a private. He aspired to become a pilot, but the Air Force detected a talent for navigation and trained him accordingly. He was a member of the U.S. Air Force Academy history faculty for 19 years. His distinguished Air Force career lasted 30 years, ending with his promotion to brigadier general and retirement in 1980.</p>

<p>Hurley plans to spend the remainder of his time as chancellor ‰ÛÏworking at full speed every day.‰Û He said, ‰ÛÏI hope to bring the capital campaign to its stated goal of $150 million, and I expect that we will continue to make progress in all that is required to position our system as a recognized, major force in meeting the ever-growing teaching, research and public service demands of our North Texas region and the State of Texas.</p>

<p>Hurley also said, ‰ÛÏI have been exploring new roles that combine my many areas of interest, including leadership in public service, consulting work in higher education, and the renewal of more of my long-deferred work in military history.‰Û</p>

<p>The University of North Texas System is the only university system whose primary mission is to serve the residents of the North Texas region. The UNT System comprises the University of North Texas at Denton, the region‰Ûªs leading public university and the flagship institution; the UNT Health Science Center at Fort Worth, the state's leading producer of primary care physicians; and the UNT System Center at Dallas, an extension of UNT at Denton, which will lead the way to the establishment of the University of North Texas at Dallas (the first public university in the City of Dallas) in the near future. Through its education, research, health care and public service missions, the system serves people in nearly every county in Texas. However, it is focused primarily on serving the residents of the 129 municipalities that comprise the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex ‰ÛÓ the consolidated statistical area of the 12 North Texas counties.</p>

",,,,,94,12/18/01 0:00,UNT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER NAMED HOME TO STATE‰ÛªS MISSING PERSONS DNA DATABASE,"<p>FORT WORTH, Texas‰ÛÓThe DNA Identity Laboratory at the UNT Health Science Center takes on an expanded role this fall with the establishment of a statewide missing persons DNA database. </p>
<p>The health science center will work with Texas law enforcement officials to establish a database of DNA samples based on unidentified human remains or a high-risk missing person. The program is funded by the Crime Victims Compensation Fund of the state‰Ûªs Office of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>Officials from around the state will collect DNA samples from unidentified human remains and submit those samples to the UNT Health Science Center for forensic DNA analysis and inclusion of the results in the DNA database. </p>
<p>Comparative data will be collected from family members of a missing person. After a missing persons report is filed, local law enforcement officials will inform the family about the Missing Persons DNA database. The family can then provide a sample of DNA for forensic analysis or a personal article belonging to the high-risk missing person for purposes of DNA sampling.  These samples will be included in the database for comparison purposes.</p>
<p>DNA samples from unidentified human remains will be compared with DNA samples from personal articles belonging to high-risk missing persons or from parents of high-risk missing persons or other appropriate persons.</p>
<p>The results of the forensic analysis will be compatible with the DNA database established by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas results will be included in that database.</p>
<p> ‰ÛÏOnce we have a direct link with the FBI, law enforcement agencies from around the country will have access to our records here,‰Û said John Planz, Ph.D., associate director of the DNA Identity Lab. ‰ÛÏWithout this database, a body may never be identified simply because they weren‰Ûªt found near their hometown. We hope that our efforts will allow unsolved cases from Texas and the rest of the country to eventually be closed.‰Û</p>
<p>This fall, the UNT Health Science Center began to develop the DNA database and center infrastructure, establish center protocols and employ center personnel.  Next year, the center will begin analyzing cases, focusing first on cases that involve children.</p>
<p>Among the initial steps will be developing a model kit to be used by a law enforcement agency to take DNA samples from parents or other appropriate persons. The center will also create an advisory committee, consisting of medical examiners, law enforcement officials, and other interested persons as determined appropriate by the center, to establish priorities regarding the identification of the backlog of high-risk missing person cases and unidentified human remains.</p>
<p>The DNA database is another part to the lab‰Ûªs ongoing relationship with the state of Texas. The DNA Identity Laboratory has provided scientific and technical support for Texas law enforcement agencies and crime labs for more than 10 years. It provides paternity testing, forensic genetic screening and DNA testing for the state of Texas. The lab is the only public agency in Texas that performs mitochondrial forensic DNA testing.</p>

<p>In honor of PA Day, the health science center‰Ûªs Physician Assistant Student Association hosted a one-hour continuing medical education seminar. The speaker was Michael Clark, PA-C, PhD, an assistant professor in the department of family medicine at the health science center. He presented, ‰ÛÏThe Physician and Physician Assistant Team in Today‰Ûªs Health Care.‰Û The program‰Ûªs objectives educated attendees about the role of the PA in today‰Ûªs health care system. More than 100 attended, including area physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and health science center students. The U.S. Naval Recruiting Command of Dallas/Fort Worth sponsored the lunch. </p>
<p>Another part of the health science center‰Ûªs celebration was a poster competition in which students highlighted Fort Worth area PAs. Posters displayed information about PAs, the PA‰Ûªs role and benefits for patients. Alumni of the health science center‰Ûªs Physician Assistant program worked with current students to inform visitors of the many specialties that employ PAs. Highlighted areas included pediatrics, geriatrics, long term care, general surgery, neurosurgery, rural family practice, multicultural family practice and nephrology. ‰ÛÏPAs in the Role of Educators‰Û won the poster competition as being the most informative poster.</p>
<p>The health science center began its Physician Assistant Studies Program in 1997 as an undergraduate program. The program became the first state-funded master‰Ûªs PA Studies program in Texas in 2000. The PA program is part of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine (TCOM), founded in 1970. TCOM is one of 19 osteopathic medical schools in the country, and the only one in Texas. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏPhysician assistants play an important role in the effort to increase patient access to health care,‰Û said Henry Lemke, PA-C, director of the health science center‰Ûªs Physician Assistant program. ‰ÛÏPASA helped in the PA Day activities by informing visitors about the roles PAs play on their health care teams.‰Û  </p>

<p>Next week, Latino lay educators - promotores ‰ÛÒ will learn how to teach individuals and families to prevent and control heart disease as part of a nationally known community-based heart-health education program, called Salud para su CorazÌ_n or Health for Your Heart. The program is being implemented locally by the School of Public Health at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.</p>
<p>Local promotores will undergo an intensive four-day training Dec. 3-6, 2001, that includes lessons on how to identify those at risk for heart disease and how a healthy lifestyle helps prevent or control heart disease. Most importantly, it offers them resources and proven methods to share this message with family members, friends, and others in their community. </p>
<p>Created by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health, Salud para su CorazÌ_n began in 1994 as a pilot project in Washington, D.C. The program now reaches across the United States to make a difference in underserved communities in Texas, Illinois, New Mexico, and California. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏHeart disease is the leading cause of death among Latinos, as it is for all Americans. But Latinos need to understand that the risk factors for heart disease, including high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, overweight, physical inactivity, and cigarette smoking can be controlled and prevented,‰Û said NHLBI Director Dr. Claude Lenfant. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏThe good news is that research has shown that the burden of illness and death associated with heart disease can be reduced by simple lifestyle changes. NHLBI is committed to taking results of ongoing studies and applying them to serve the public health. Salud para su CorazÌ_n does that by training the promotores to help Latinos make those changes and live a healthy lifestyle,‰Û Lenfant added. </p>
<p>Through a variety of creative activities, including cooking demonstrations, ‰ÛÏweigh-ins,‰Û and participation in physical activity, the promotores bring life-saving heart-health information to their neighbors and families. Salud para su Corazon‰Ûªs culturally-appropriate educational materials are offered in both English and Spanish. </p>
<p>According to Hector Balcazar, Ph.D., department chair and professor in the School of Public Health at the UNT Health Science Center, Latino children are experiencing a dramatic increase in obesity. In addition, he notes that high blood pressure levels and the rise of diabetes in young Latino children are alarming developments and must be addressed through prevention efforts in Latino families. </p>
<p>‰ÛÏSalud para su CorazÌ_n‰Ûªs promotores know the problems that families face and are realistic about teaching them how to make small changes in their behavior that lead to improved health,‰Û said Dr. Balcazar. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, the UNTHSC Salud para su CorazÌ_n program was named one of six NHLBI-supported cardiovascular disease (CVD) Enhanced Dissemination and Utilization Centers (EDUCs). These EDUCS are the first in what will eventually be a nationwide network of community-based organizations implementing targeted, culturally sensitive heart health education strategies aimed at preventing and controlling CVD and promoting heart-healthy behavior in communities with far higher than average CVD death rates. </p>
<p>The UNT Health Science Center is working with staff from nine network organizations and community-based groups, including the UNTHSC Northside Family Practice Clinic, the City of Fort Worth Public Health Department, the Tarrant County Public Health Department, The Dallas Concilio and others. Together, these partners hope to develop a comprehensive health promotion, health education and outreach initiative to increase awareness and knowledge about cardiovascular disease prevention and promote heart-healthy lifestyles among Hispanics. In addition to developing the network of promotores, the intervention will also create a variety of neighborhood and community-wide awareness and education activities, such as guided group discussions, or charlas, community health fairs, cooking demonstrations, and mass media activities to reach community residents with heart health and family wellness messages.</p>

Cohen, D.O., F.A.C.O.P., provost and senior vice president for health affairs at the University of North Texas Health Science Center, recently received the Dale Dodson Award from the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine for his outstanding contributions to osteopathic medical education.</p>
<p>In nominating Dr. Cohen for the Dodson Award, Sandra Featherman, Ph.D., president of the University of New England, said, ‰ÛÏBen‰Ûªs intelligence and commitment to osteopathic medical education are each prodigious. Through his leadership role in encouraging the sharing of valuable information, he has helped the entire profession of osteopathic medical education move forward.‰Û </p>
<p>The Dodson Award is named after a former president of the American Osteopathic Association. The Dodson Award recognizes an outstanding leader from one of the osteopathic medical colleges who goes above and beyond the call of duty to advance osteopathic medicine. </p>
<p>Through his tenure in several positions at the UNT Health Science Center and its Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, Dr. Cohen‰Ûªs commitment to academic rigor and excellence, as well as to clinical and basic science research, have brought recognition, credibility and visibility to osteopathic medical education.</p>
<p>Dr. Cohen joined the UNT Health Science Center in 1990 as vice president for academic affairs and dean of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine. During the past 11 years, he has played a key role in leading the academic team through the process of changing the status of the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine from a medical school to an academic health science center.

Hancher, MD, said. ‰ÛÏIt is our association‰Ûªs public duty to educate and prepare physicians for the kind of attack we all pray we‰Ûªll never have to face.‰Û
<p>‰ÛÏPhysicians clearly must be in the forefront of dealing with bioterrorism,‰Û Dr. Blanck said. ‰ÛÏTexas is fortunate to have all the expertise necessary, and then some, to provide physicians with the information they need to counsel patients, be part of efforts to prepare, and of course to be aware of the possible presence of these diseases.‰Û
<p>Fernando TreviÌ±o, PhD, MPH, dean and professor of the health science center‰Ûªs School of Public Health, will join Dr. Blanck as a member of the task force. 
<p>Drs. Hancher and Blanck said the task force will provide solid recommendations on how individual physicians and the entire medical community can better prepare to respond to a bioterrorism attack. Much of the group‰Ûªs work will involve pulling together and coordinating existing resources and making them more widely available.
<p>The task force will collate and provide individual physicians with information such as:
<ul><li>What physicians should look for and what they should do to help a patient who may have been exposed to a biological or chemical weapon;</li>
<li>How and where to report suspected outbreaks of diseases such as anthrax, smallpox, plague and botulism;</li>
<li>What physicians should tell their patients who are concerned about bioterrorism attacks;</li>
<li>How physicians should respond if they are asked to look at a possible act of bioterrorism; and</li>
<li>Where physicians can obtain additional scientific information on bioterrorism, such as on the Internet, via satellite programming, or in community-based continuing medical education programs.</li></ul></p>
<p>In looking at the larger picture, the task force will:
<ul><li> Inventory the capacity of the state‰Ûªs public health infrastructure to deal with bioterrorism or terrorism acts;</li>
<li>Identify effective community response systems that could be replicated in other communities; and</li>
<li>Coordinate its efforts with other public safety task forces or working groups that are investigating bioterrorism. </li></ul></p>

<p>The Texas Medical Association is the largest state medical society in the nation, representing more than 37,000 physician and medical student members. It is located in Austin and has 119 component county medical societies around the state. TMA's key objective is to improve the health of all Texans. </p>

<p>Study authors, including researchers at the University of North Texas Health Science Center, measured C-reactive protein levels, along with cholesterol levels, to gain insight into who can benefit from preventive drug therapy. The study showed that statin drug therapy may help prevent coronary events in people who have elevated C-reactive protein values but whose baseline levels of LDL cholesterol are considered normal. If confirmed in additional studies, the results may provide persuasive evidence for measuring both C-reactive protein and blood lipids in healthy adults. </p>
<p>Results are based on further analysis of the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS), a primary prevention trial of Merck and Co.‰Ûªs cholesterol-lowering drug Mevacor‰ÛÏ (lovastatin). Researchers studied whether study participants with elevated C-reactive protein levels but no hyperlipidema benefited from taking the drug. </p>
<p>The AFCAPS/TexCAPS was conducted between 1990 and 1998 at the UNT Health Science Center in Fort Worth and the Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.</p>
<p>Michael Clearfield, D.O., chief of internal medicine at the UNT Health Science Center, served as principal investigator for the TexCAPS study. Stephen Weis, D.O., professor of internal medicine, was a co-investigator for the study.</p>
<p>""Half the people who develop heart disease have a cholesterol level that is considered to be normal and many do not have other identified risk factors,"" said Dr. Clearfield. ""We now have a way to better identify apparently healthy people who can benefit from preventive treatment.""</p>
<p>AFCAPS/TexCAPS included 6,605 participants whose average cholesterol levels were 221 at baseline and had average HDL cholesterol levels of 37. Between 1990 and 1998, a total of 2,868 participants took part in the study through the TexCAPS clinics located on the health science center‰Ûªs campus in Fort Worth‰Ûªs cultural district. The remaining participants were studied in San Antonio.</p>

<p>The James L. West Alzheimer Center has joined the Consortium on Alzheimer‰Ûªs Research and Education (CARE) Program at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. As part of the statewide consortium, the West Alzheimer Center will work with the health science center on research, education, and training efforts devoted to evaluation, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease.</p>
<p>One of the first research projects involves a pilot program studying the feasibility of using telemedicine to evaluate and treat people with Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease. An interactive computer system has been installed between the two facilities that allows residents, staff and physicians to talk and see one another in real time. This technology can provide the resident greater access to a wide range of specialists and may prove to enhance the quality of care, provide more timely care, and reduce the cost of care.</p>
<p>""This is a win-win partnership,"" said Thomas Fairchild, Ph.D., director of Special Projects on Aging at the health science center. ""We‰Ûªve been studying Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease for years, and the West Alzheimer Center is well known for its innovative approach to caring for patients who suffer from the disease.""</p>
<p>""Our affiliation with the CARE Program demonstrates the West Center‰Ûªs commitment to research,"" said Moira Reinhardt, the center‰Ûªs executive director. ""Our residents‰Ûª families are thrilled that they and their loved ones can be part of this special program that has so much potential to help other people affected by Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease.""</p>
<p>The James L. West Alzheimer Center opened in 1993 as one of the nation‰Ûªs first free-standing facilities exclusively for the care of persons with Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease and related disorders. Today, the center provides full-time residential care, respite care, and a day program for more than 120 people with Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease or some other form of dementia.</p>
<p>The UNT Health Science Center has a long-standing commitment to improving the care provided to the growing population of those over age 65. It was among the first in the country to offer specialized medical training in geriatric care and conduct research into aging issues. The health science center was the first medical school in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to establish a geriatric fellowship program that offers physicians and dentists advanced training in caring for elderly patients.</p>
<p>The CARE Program links UNT Health Science Center researchers and faculty physicians with providers at select Texas facilities that provide quality care to people with dementia. The program is working on expanding the number of facilities and its geographic scope.</p>
<p>Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease is a progressive, degenerative neurological disorder that interferes with daily functioning and eventually causes death. It is the fourth leading cause of death in American adults. </p>

	<p>E. Helene Sage, Ph.D., director of vascular biology at Seattle‰Ûªs Hope Heart Institute, will present an overview of her work at an afternoon seminar. Her presentation will begin at 2 p.m., Thursday, May 31 in the Education and Administration Building on the UNT Health Science Center campus.</p>
	<p>""We‰Ûªve established this new seminar to share some of the exciting work that is being done in vision research across the country with the medical professionals and scientists here in North Texas,"" said Patrick Cammarata, Ph.D., director of the North Texas Eye Research Institute.  </p>
	<p>Dr. Sage currently studies the regulation of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, as well as the response of connective tissue cells to injury. She has spent several years focusing on the matricellular protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) and its role as a critical regulator of vascular morphogenesis. SPARC acts as an adaptor molecule between the cell surface and connective tissue/extracellular matrix components. It regulates cell proliferation, cell-matrix interaction, and other aspects of morphogenesis, tissue response to injury, and tumor growth and metastasis. </p>
<p>	Her vision research results from examining the numerous physical effects of a lack of SPARC. She has found that, in the eye, a SPARC deficiency in mice consistently leads to defective lenses and cataractogenisis.</p>
<p>	A magna cum laude graduate of Mt. Holyoke College, Dr. Sage received her doctoral degree from the University of Utah. Her postdoctoral training focused on cell biology and biochemistry at the University of Washington, in the laboratory of Dr. Paul Bornstein. She has been a faculty member at the University of Washington since 1980.</p>
<p>	The Distinguished Scientist in Vision was created as a forum to bring leading eye researchers to Fort Worth to share their work with the local health and science community. Alcon Laboratories, Inc. is helping to underwrite the event, and Dr. Sage will visit Alcon‰Ûªs facilities June 1 as part of her visit to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>The award will be officially announced at a reception to be held at 3 p.m., Wednesday, May 23, in the UNT Health Science Center Atrium. For more information about the reception, call 817-735-2113.</p>
<p>According to ACS, the Institute‰Ûªs application for funding ranked second of the 26 new or competing renewals from many of the major cancer institutes in the United States. The UNT Health Science Center is the only North Texas institution to receive an ACS institutional research grant and one of only four in the state of Texas. The other three Texas recipients are Baylor College of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, and UT San Antonio Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>The institutional research grant provides $150,000 over a three-year period to fund junior faculty and their cancer-related projects, in such areas as basic science, translational and clinical research, prevention and control, early diagnosis and treatment, behavioral oncology research and educational programs. These start-up grants often later lead to additional funding at much higher levels by ACS, the federal government, and other sources.</p>
<p>""We are now recognized by our peers as an outstanding, new and developing Institute for Cancer Research,"" said Ronald H. Goldfarb, Ph.D., institute director and principal investigator on the grant. ""This award validates that the cancer research we are conducting in North Texas is of the highest quality.""</p>
<p>In addition to the UNT Health Science Center, other members of the cancer research grant consortium include the University of North Texas at Denton, Texas Christian University, Texas Wesleyan University, and the University of Texas at Arlington and its Automation and Robotics Research Institute. Junior researchers at these partner institutions are eligible to apply to the Institute for Cancer Research for funding from the ACS grant.</p>
<p>""The American Cancer Society is the largest private funder of cancer-related research in the world. The U. S. government is the only larger source of cancer research funding,"" said Donna Rankin, executive director of the ACS Fort Worth metro unit. ""We are extremely pleased to see that we are able to fund researchers who are working in our own backyard.""</p>
<p>The Institute for Cancer Research was established in January 1999 to study all aspects of cancer, with a focus on cancer that spreads in the human body. The Institute contributes to new approaches for cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>ACS has funded over $2.3 billion in cancer research since 1946 when the program was first launched. Among these researchers are 30 Nobel Prize winners who received grant support from ACS early in their careers. Thirty-seven percent of every dollar given to ACS goes to fund this outstanding research program. In 1946, only 25 percent of cancer patients were alive five years after diagnosis. Today, almost 60 percent live longer than five years. </p>

<p>The six organizations, named Enhanced Dissemination and Utilization Centers, are located in communities with heart disease and stroke death rates far in excess of the national average. They are the first to be selected to participate in what will eventually be a nationwide NHLBI network of community-based organizations implementing targeted, culturally sensitive heart health education strategies aimed at changing local physician practices and patient behaviors. </p>
<p>Public health and medical school faculty from the health science center will develop a comprehensive health promotion, health education and outreach program to increase awareness and knowledge about cardiovascular disease prevention and to promote heart-healthy lifestyles among Hispanics. The health science center will work with staff at its Northside Family Practice Clinic, as well as Harris Methodist Fort Worth Hospital, The Hispanic Coalition of Fort Worth and The Dallas Concilio on the project.</p>
<p>The UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs School of Public Health will receive $429,000 in funding from the NHLBI over the next three years to support its activities.  </p>
<p>Hector Balcazar, Ph.D., is a professor in the School of Public Health and principal investigator on the project. Co-investigators include health science center faculty members Adela Gonzalez, vice president of strategic and institutional affairs, and Muriel Marshall, D.O., Dr. P.H., associate professor in the School of Public Health and department of family medicine.</p>
<p>""This project uses the Salud para su CorazÌ_n (Health for your Heart) model to guide a variety of dissemination strategies into target Hispanic communities,"" said Dr. Balcazar. ""We‰Ûªre partnering to make Salud para su CorazÌ_n a reality for our Latino family.""
<p>The Salud para su CorazÌ_n model uses promotoras, lay health educators, to reach Latino families with educational messages and interventions that reflect the needs of the family. The lay health educators will receive training, which provides them with in-depth and user-friendly tools to promote heart health and family wellness. </p>
<p>Through this program, the School of Public Health will host community activities, such as guided group discussions, community health fairs and cooking demonstrations. </p>
<p>The other five organizations are The Dan River Region Cardiovascular Health Initiative Program in Southside, Virginia, the Delta Health Education Center at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, St. Mary‰Ûªs Hospital in Huntington, West Virginia, Wake Forest University School of Medicine and West Virginia‰Ûªs Health Right, Inc.‰Ûªs Health Heart Project. </p>
",,,,,57,3/27/01 0:00,UNT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER LICENSES CARDIAC ASSIST DEVICE ,"<p>FORT WORTH, Texas‰ÛÓ Researchers at the University of North Texas Health Science Center have developed a new tool for heart surgeons and cardiologists that potentially will support circulation following heart surgery or heart attacks better than devices currently in use.</p>
<p>The ""Enhanced Intra-Aortic Balloon Assist Device"" is specifically designed to maintain the aortic blood pressure at an adequate level by overcoming limitations of current devices. The U.S. Patent Office approved the device February 20, 2001, (Patent No. 6,190,304 B1). 
UNT Health Science Center has licensed exclusive worldwide rights to the device to Cardiac Surgical Devices, Inc., a privately held start-up company based in Irvine, California. In exchange, the health science center has acquired 20 percent of the company‰Ûªs outstanding stock.</p>
<p>Currently, cardiologists or cardiac surgeons use regular intra-aortic balloon assist devices to reduce the heart‰Ûªs workload and improve flow of blood to a patient‰Ûªs brain, heart, and other vital organs. These pumps may not provide adequate circulatory support for patients with severely diseased or injured hearts.</p>
<p>Xiaoming Bian, M.D., Ph.D., and H. Fred Downey, Ph.D., researchers with the health science center‰Ûªs Cardiovascular Research Institute, invented the Enhanced Intra-aortic Balloon Assist Device to improve blood flow and provide circulatory support when pressures fall below those required by currently available devices. The device adds an external pumping module that works in series with an internal pump in cases where conventional intra-aortic balloon pumps are unable to maintain adequate blood flow.</p>
<p>""This device has the potential to provide additional support for patients with failing hearts,"" said Dr. Downey, who has studied coronary circulation for more than 30 years. ""Results from our initial prototype testing and simulation studies have been very promising.""

<ul>
<li>Contact with students begins through Adopt-A-School partnerships with Fort Worth Independent School District elementary, middle, and high schools that serve predominantly Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods. Health science center faculty serve as research mentors, judge science fairs and speak at career day events. </li> 
<li>Student Teacher Applied Research Training (START) provides practical experience for high school students and their science teachers during summer internships at the health science center.</li>
<li>Summer Minority Advanced Research Training (SMART) offers college sophomores the opportunity to conduct focused research at the health science center. They then present the results of their studies at the prestigious National Minority Research Symposium.</li>
<li>The UNT Health Science Center is one of only two free-standing graduate schools of the 159 institutions chosen to participate in the Ronald E. McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement Program. The health science center has established a continuity of exposure to biomedical research by selecting its McNair scholars from the ranks of its SMART students and partner institutions. </li>
<li>In the Bridges to the Doctoral Degree program, the health science centers partners with predominantly minority universities to help develop under-represented and disadvantaged students who are entering doctoral programs. The program results in faculty exchange activities and an influx of students from the partner institutions into the doctoral program at the health science center. In addition, these partnerships have enabled other students from the partner institutions to pursue their graduate and professional education at the health science center in non-Bridge programs.</li>
<li>A partnership with Jarvis Christian College started in 1980 with a grant-supported effort to train faculty from historically black colleges for new areas of research in diseases that impact Blacks, specifically hypertension. The relationship with the college has expanded to include seminars, joint research grants and training support. Several Jarvis students have graduated from the health science center, and the college continues to be a partner in the McNair and SMART programs.</li>
<li>Sponsorship of Minority Graduate Student Organizations has grown with the support of the Outreach Office. The Black Graduate Students Association, the Society for the Advancement of Latin Scholars in America (SALSA), and the McNair/SMART Scholars Association provide support for entering students to enhance their sense of belonging and ownership of the institution. These students assist in recruiting new students into the health science center, serve on the selection committee for SMART/McNair Scholars and act as mentors for new students entering the institution.</li>
</ul>
",,,,,55,3/20/01 0:00,UNT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER RECOGNIZED FOR MINORITY OUTREACH EFFORTS,"<p>FORT WORTH, Texas‰ÛÓ An organization working with the National Institutes of Health has designated the University of North Texas Health Science Center a ""Role Model Institution"" for its efforts in recruiting minority students.</p>
<p>Minority Access, Inc. assists federal agencies, universities, and corporations to diversify their worksites and/or classrooms. It works with the National Institutes of Health‰Ûªs (NIH) Office of Minority Research to identify institutions with an exemplary commitment to and success in producing minority biomedical student researchers. It will provide the names of all role model institutions to the NIH‰Ûªs newly established National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities. </p>
<p>The UNT Health Science Center was selected as a role model because of the ongoing outreach efforts of its Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. The outreach efforts contributed to an increase in African-American and Hispanic students at the health science center while national enrollment figures were declining.</p>
<p>""We designed creative strategies to reach new students, and they‰Ûªve been the key to recruiting minority students into studying science here,"" said Thomas Yorio, Ph.D., dean of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. ""We encourage students from elementary school through their college years to enter science fields.""</p>
<p>In the academic year 1999-2000, the graduate school was recognized as the leading State of Texas health science center based on the percentage of its minority graduate enrollment. In the present entering class, fully 36 percent of the class is under-represented minorities, almost equal to the 39 percent of the class that is Caucasian students.</p>
<p>In 1993, the Graduate School opened with 66 students, including five Hispanics and one African-American. This fall, 113 students were enrolled in the program, including 15 Hispanics and 11 African-Americans.  </p>
<p>""We recruit one student at a time and then ask those students to recruit others,"" said Robert Kaman, Ph.D., J.D., director of the Minority Outreach Office at the health science center. ""We also build relationships with institutions that have strong science programs but no doctoral degrees. Working together, we can bridge their students‰Ûª education into a doctoral degree in biomedical sciences.""</p>
<p>The Role Model Project identifies institutions that excel in producing minority researchers. As an award recipient, the health science center will share its methods at a national conference this fall in Washington, D.C.</p>

The National Cancer Institute, of the National Institutes of Health, is supporting this research with a Small Business Innovative Research grant to &Aring;ngstrom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of San Diego.  The health science center, as &Aring;ngstrom&rsquo;s research partner, will receive more than $170,000 for its work with the project.</p> <p>The research effort will help further develop new anti-tumor therapy agents invented by &Aring;ngstrom.  Research efforts that generate successful results in the laboratory can lead to clinical trials and eventually bring new drugs into the marketplace.</p> <p>&quot;Our work with &Aring;ngstrom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. may lead to new ways to fight cancer,&quot; said Ronald H. Goldfarb, PhD, director of UNT Health Science Center&rsquo;s Institute for Cancer Research.  &quot;If we can prevent the outgrowth of metastases following their establishment at distant sites in the body where they are much more difficult to treat, we can increase the odds for long-term cancer survival.&quot;</p> <p>The project will assess the efficacy of a cyclic peptide, called &Aring;36.  Initial research has shown that &Aring;36 can stop the process that leads to tumor cell invasion, metastatic spread and new blood vessel formulation (angiogenesis). The study will use xenograft models of human colon cancer and prostate cancer.</p>   <p>Tumors use the process of angiogenesis to promote their growth and spread (metastasis).  Drugs that block this process are expected to have a major impact on the treatment of most types of cancer.  Unlike conventional chemotherapy, which targets rapidly growing cell populations and has serious side-effects, anti-angiogenic drugs are expected to be far less toxic and have little potential to induce drug resistance. </p> <p>UNT Health Science Center researchers will evaluate &Aring;36 for its anti-tumor activity and determine whether the drug is suitable for further pre-clinical development and eventual clinical testing.  Other studies will examine the pharmacokinetics and toxicology of &Aring;36. </p> <p>The overall principal investigator is Terence R. Jones, PhD, president and chief executive officer of &Aring;ngstrom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Dr. Goldfarb will work as principal investigator on two components of the grant, one of which Kenneth W. Brunson, PhD, deputy director of the Institute for Cancer Research, will serve as co-principal investigator. Richard P. Kitson, PhD, an Institute member and research associate professor at the health science center, will work as co-investigator on the other.</p> <p>The grant supports the ongoing partnership between UNT Health Science Center and &Aring;ngstrom.  The company has funded previous cancer research at the health science center to investigate the effects of another of its drugs, &Aring;6, on human non-small cell lung cancer metastases. Moreover, Dr. Goldfarb and Dr. Kitson are co-principal investigators on a state of Texas Advanced Technology Grant (ATP) investigating the effects of &Aring;6 plus anti-cancer chemotherapy. Dr. Goldfarb also serves on &Aring;ngstrom&rsquo;s Scientific Advisory Board.</p> <p>San Diego-based &Aring;ngstrom Pharmaceuticals (www.angstrominc.com) was formed in 1996 to add a new dimension to drug discovery.   It is committed to discovering small-molecule drugs that block extracellular cytokine-receptor interactions responsible for &quot;switching on&quot; disease processes.  The company has chosen cancer as its first focus and is currently outlicensing its proprietary drugs that target solid tumor growths and metastasis.</p> <p>UNT Health Science Center&rsquo;s Institute for Cancer Research was developed in January 1999 to study how cancer spreads in the human body.  The Institute contributes to new approaches for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.</p>",,,,,37,11/27/00 0:00,"DNA RESEARCH AT UNT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER 
FOCUSES ON IMPROVING TEST RESULTS ON SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE<br>
<i>Research Funded By National Institute Of Justice</i>","<p>   FORT WORTH, Texas‰ÛÓThe quality of the evidence is critical to solving any crime, and when trying to identify a rapist, crime labs need the best specimen available. Successful DNA testing can mean the difference between an unsolved crime and an arrest.</p>
<p>    The DNA Identity Laboratory at the University of North Texas Health Science Center is working on an innovative system that, if successful, will enhance the quality of the specimen by first separating sperm from the rest of the sexual assault evidence and then amplifying its DNA.</p>
<p>    ""This antibody/magnetic bead reagent system should offer the forensic community a differential extraction methodology that results in greater yields and higher purity of sperm DNA,"" said Arthur J. Eisenberg, PhD, director of the DNA Identity Lab.</p>
<p>    The National Institute of Justice has awarded $272,000 to the health science center to fund the DNA research. Researchers will evaluate the reagent system and attempt to automate the cellular sorting method that isolates the sperm cells from other evidence.</p>
<p>Current methods to extract sperm and purify DNA for sexual assault evidence can be lengthy and tedious. The extracting procedures are often incomplete, and the final product may contain DNA from both the victim and the assailant.</p>
<p>    An automated extraction system is essential to decrease the existing backlog of unresolved sexual assault cases in the United States. The long-term success of the new nationwide Combined DNA Indexing System also relies on analyzing all rape/sexual assault cases, especially those lacking a known suspect.  </p>
<p>    ""Without an automated extraction system, the backlog of cases will continue to grow,"" said Dr. Eisenberg. ""We‰Ûªre hoping to change from the current labor intensive system to an automated one that produces better and faster results.""</p>
<p>    The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 350,000 rapes and sexual assaults were experienced by persons age 12 or older in the United States in 1995. About 100,000 of these are actually reported to the authorities, with only approximately 25,000 cases analyzed by crime labs nationwide. </p>
<p>    The health science center‰Ûªs DNA Identity Laboratory provides scientific and technical support for Texas law enforcement agencies and crime labs. It provides DNA testing for the state of Texas in sexual assault cases that result in conception. The lab is the only public agency in Texas that performs mitochondrial forensic DNA testing.  </p>
<p>    The DNA Identity Laboratory was created in 1989 to provide paternity testing and forensic genetic screenings.  Since then, the lab has performed more than 50,000 paternity tests.  </p>
   <p> This year, the UNT Health Science Center established a new master‰Ûªs degree program in forensic genetics. The program trains professionals in forensic genetics at a level that surpasses the requirements instituted by the national standards for forensic DNA analysis. Graduates will be qualified to do forensic casework, human population genetics, parentage testing, criminalistics, genetic data analysis, human identification, biostatistics, wildlife forensics and molecular genetics.</p>",,,,,33,11/14/00 0:00,"UNT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER PRESIDENT RECEIVES

<p>The asthma study will be testing a medication currently used for asthma in patients over the age of 6. This study seeks to lower the approved age use of the medication.</p>
<p>This research study addresses the use of preventive asthma therapy in an age group for which there is few options. The goal is to show less hospitalizations, decreased need for rescue medications and less frequent visits to the emergency room. Currently there is only one preventive medication available for children in this age group, but it is administered four times a day.</p>
<p>Asthma medications help reduce underlying inflammation in the airways and relieve or prevent narrowing of the airways. Control of inflammation should lead to reduction in airway sensitivity and help prevent airway obstruction. </p>
<p>Study participants must meet age requirements and have a history of asthma and a previous need for rescue medications for eligibility in the study. The principal investigator for the study is Dr. Alan Levine, a pediatrician at the UNT Health Science Center‰Ûªs Pediatric Clinic.</p>
<p>Enrollment will continue at the health science center until 10-20 children are participating in the study. Approximately 30 sites in the country will be enrolling study participants.</p>
<p>Asthma is the leading serious chronic illness among children. Of the approximate 17 million asthmatics in the country, almost one third of them are children under 18 years of age. Most children have mild to moderate problems, and their illness can be controlled by treatment at home or in the doctor's office. The estimated annual cost of treating asthma in those under 18 years of age is $3.2 billion. </p>
<p>All study-related medication, tests and exams will be provided free of charge. In many cases, volunteers are compensated for their time and travel expenses. Those interested can discuss clinical research participation with their doctor and call the Office of Clinical Trials at (817) 735-0256.</p>",,,,,3,1/28/00 0:00,CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING MEDICINE UNDER REVIEW AT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER,"<p>FORT WORTH - Texas ‰ÛÒ A cholesterol-lowering medication is being studied at the UNT Health Science Center and researchers are seeking patients who have evidence of vascular disease and an LDL cholesterol level of greater than 160 mg/d to enroll in the study.</p>
<p>The study medication, which is a type of statin, is currently not available through physicians or pharmacies. According to Dr. Michael Clearfield, chief of internal medicine and primary investigator for the study, the purpose of the study is to test this new medicine against the strongest cholesterol-lowering drug currently available. Researchers hope this new statin will be more effective in lowering cholesterol. Dr. Martin Weiss, cardiologist with the health science center, is also a co-investigator.</p>
<p>Cholesterol is a fatty substance in the body which, in high levels, is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. Extra cholesterol in the blood collects in the inner walls of the arteries, allowing less blood to get to the heart.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Clearfield, the higher your total cholesterol number, the higher the risk for heart disease.  In this study those with an LDL cholesterol of over 160 mg/dl are being sought.  Most people with an LDL over 160 mg/dl  would expect to have a total cholesterol over 220 mg/dl.</p>
<p>Cholesterol travels in the blood in packages called lipoproteins. Cholesterol packaged in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is often called ""bad"" cholesterol, because too much LDL in blood can lead to cholesterol buildup and blockage in the arteries. An LDL level of 100 mg/dL or lower  is desirable for people with vascular disease, such as those in this study.</p>
<p>The study is being conducted in over 30 centers in the United States. Health science center researchers will be seeking study participants for several months.</p>
<p>All research study-related medication, tests and exams will be provided free of charge. In many cases, volunteers are compensated for their time and travel expenses. Those interested can discuss clinical research participation with their doctor and call the Office of Clinical Trials at (817) 735-0256.</p>",,,,,2,1/28/00 0:00,HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER SEEKS PARTICIPANTS FOR EPILEPSY STUDY,"<p>FORT WORTH - Texas ‰ÛÒ A new medication is being studied at the UNT Health Science Center in the search for a more effective antiepileptic drug without as many side effects. Researchers are seeking additional medications so patients will have more options to choose from in their therapy.</p>
<p>The health science center is seeking males and females over the age of 12 with incompletely controlled epilepsy on at least one antiepileptic drug already.  According to Dr. William McIntosh, chief of neurology at the UNT Health Science Center and the primary investigator in the study, the health science center is one of 80 sites in the United States and Canada seeking a total of 400 patients to enroll in the study. The health science center will seek participants to monitor on the new medication throughout the year.</p>
<p>Researchers hope the use of this study medication will prevent the number of seizures in patients. Most of these antiepileptic medications are not effective until they reach a certain level in the body, and that level has to be maintained. The goal is to keep the blood level high enough to prevent seizures, but not so high that it causes excessive sleepiness or other unpleasant side effects. </p>
<p>Previously over a dozen drugs, the oldest dating back to 1912, have been available for those with epilepsy. The most commonly prescribed drug still used today was developed in the 1950s.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, nearly 1.4 million Americans have epilepsy, with the majority of these Americans under age 45. Epilepsy is a neurological condition that from time to time produces brief disturbances in the normal electrical functions of the brain. Normal brain function is made possible by millions of tiny electrical charges passing between nerve cells in the brain and to all parts of the body. When someone has epilepsy, this normal pattern may be interrupted by irregular bursts of electrical energy (called epileptic seizures) that are much more intense than usual. They may affect a person's consciousness, bodily movements or sensations for a short time. </p>
<p>In about seven out of ten people with epilepsy, no cause can be found. Among the rest, the cause may be any one of a number of things that can make a difference in the way the brain works, including head injuries, brain tumors, genetic conditions, problems in development of the brain before birth, and infections like meningitis or encephalitis.</p>
<p>All study-related medication, tests and exams will be provided free of charge. In many cases, volunteers are compensated for their time and travel expenses. Those interested can discuss clinical research participation with their doctor and call the Office of Clinical Trials at (817) 735-0256.</p>",,,,,1,1/4/00 0:00,UNT HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER STUDENTS NAMED TO NATIONAL WHO‰ÛªS WHO,"<p>FORT WORTH - Texas &ndash; The distinction of Who&rsquo;s Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges was awarded to 24 students from the four education components of the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.</p> <p>Students were selected by campus nominating committees, which were comprised of administration, faculty and student body members.
