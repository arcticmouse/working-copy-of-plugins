That‰Ûªs why we‰Ûªve been doing it now for 14 years. The hope is that one or more of the compounds that we‰Ûªve been working on for more than a decade will get into and through clinical trials and will become part of the options for treating or preventing Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease. If that‰Ûªs the case, then the public investment in this program will have been worthwhile.‰Ûù<br><br>            Thus far, research from the program project grant has spawned patents in several countries, including the United States and Japan, as well as a European patent. Migenix, Inc. of Vancouver, British Colombia, holds the licensing for some of the compounds discovered so far as a part of the grant.<br><br>            Peter Koulen, PhD, associate professor in the department of pharmacology and neuroscience at the health science center, also serves on the grant. Dr. Koulen is principal investigator of core C, which is the neuroimaging core, and principal investigator of project 5, which will focus on the role of calcium in the development of Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease.<br><br>            ‰ÛÏMy role in this project is also to coordinate with the project investigators and principal investigators of other projects,‰Ûù Dr. Koulen said. ‰ÛÏThat‰Ûªs one of the beauties of this program project. We‰Ûªre not just an array of four independent NIH grants; we also have certain mechanisms built into this project that allow us, when we are finding interesting things in our area, to apply that to the other areas, and we advance and move into another direction. So the overall project is more than its individual components.‰Ûù<br><br>            The core facility that Dr. Koulen will be running at the health science center will validate the results of other projects. Dr. Simpkins will run core A, the administrative core, at the health science center. Other cores include core B, the vector core, housed at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and core D, the drug synthesis core, housed at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.<br><br>             ‰ÛÏThese cores provide support for every one of the research activities,‰Ûù Dr. Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏThey are pretty unique to program project grants.‰Ûù<br><br>            The grant also contains four projects, including those of Dr. Simpkins and Dr. Koulen. The project headed by Dr. Simpkins is a continuation of research on the use of non-feminizing estrogen to treat Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease. The project headed by Edwin M. Meyer, PhD, at the University of Florida in Gainesville will work to develop nicotinic compounds to use as novel gene therapies for treatment of Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease. The project headed by Michael A. King, PhD, at the University of Florida in Gainesville will study and develop the vectors for Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease modeling and therapy.<br><br>‰ÛÏEach of the grant components is developing drugs or technology for their potential to treat Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease,‰Ûù Dr. Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏThis program, unlike most academic programs, has resulted in, to date, two compounds being in clinical trials. That‰Ûªs very unusual for an academic setting. And that‰Ûªs one of the reasons that this program has been sustained, now for 14 years. We understand Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease better. We understand better potential therapies, and we have delivered some of those drugs to clinical trials.‰Ûù<br><br>            This program project grant is the second program project grant that the department of pharmacology and neuroscience has received from the NIH. The first grant, which is ongoing, supports the study of the effects of normal aging on the brain. Dr. Simpkins and Dr. Koulen are part of that program project grant as well.<br><br>            ‰ÛÏThere are probably only a dozen academic departments in the country that can make the claim that they have two program project grants,‰Ûù Dr. Simpkins said. ‰ÛÏSo I think that‰Ûªs an indicator of the national status of this department.‰Ûù<br><br>            According to Dr. Koulen, the infrastructure and support of the health science center have been integral to receiving the two program project grants.<br><br>             ‰ÛÏI think one of the reasons why this is possible is that we have highly interactive departments and researchers within departments, and we have an administration that encourages this kind of collaborative research,‰Ûù Dr. Koulen said.            With continued funding from this program project grant, Dr. Simpkins believes that eventually Alzheimer‰Ûªs disease will either be prevented or cured.<br><br>###<br><br><strong>Contact:</strong> Kay Colley 817-735-2553, cell 817-980-5090, e-mail <a href=""mailto:kacolley@hsc.unt.edu"">kacolley@hsc.unt.edu</a>.",,,,,327,4/26/05 0:00,WINNERS OF 12-COUNTY ART COMPETITION ANNOUNCED,"Area high school students received awards during the 12-county high school art competition University of  North Texas Health Science Center.<br><br>The art show, sponsored by the UNT Health Science Center and Asel Art Supply, began April 2, and judging took place April 3.

The initiative went statewide, and so when Dr. Evans became president of APHA, he requested Dr. TreviÌ±o‰Ûªs help in making Public Health Week a national event.<br><br>‰ÛÏHe approached me and said the one thing that he wanted to get done as part of his term was to get a National Public Health Week,‰Ûù Dr. TreviÌ±o said. ‰ÛÏSo we went to work on that. I got my government relations people to start talking to Donna Shalala, and we worked it for a year. We got her support, and then we went up to the president. Both of them agreed that it would be a good way to bring attention to public health.‰Ûù<br><br>Later during his tenure as executive director of the APHA, Dr. TreviÌ±o was also elected president of the World Federation of Public Health Associations, where he worked to build bridges and increase the visibility of public health worldwide.<br><br> ‰ÛÏI started telling other countries what we were doing to increase the visibility of public health,‰Ûù Dr. TreviÌ±o said. ‰ÛÏWhat I found was that it doesn‰Ûªt matter if it‰Ûªs Czechoslovakia, Nigeria or China, the public really doesn‰Ûªt understand public health, so the other countries were really trying to emulate the American approach.‰Ûù<br><br>In looking back on his time as executive director of the American Public Health Association, Dr. TreviÌ±o points to the increased awareness of public health and increased funding of public health as successes.<br><br>‰ÛÏBack then, public health was really unknown by most people,‰Ûù Dr. TreviÌ±o said. ‰ÛÏI think that maybe one percent of the population could correctly identify what public is.  One of the things that was really positive that I remember was the American Medical News (the newspaper of the American Medical Association) reported right at the end, after the Clinton administration was unable to reform healthcare, that the one winner out of all of the debate had been public health because, in fact, the public knew much more about public health and how important it was, and so did healthcare workers.‰Ûù<br><br>When Dr. TreviÌ±o left the APHA in 1996, he went back to university life. Shortly after, he helped start the health science center‰Ûªs School of Public Health.<br><br> Since that day 10 years ago, Dr. TreviÌ±o has left the planning of National Public Health Week to officials at APHA at the national level and students at the local level, but it was his hard work 10 years ago that has spawned a national tradition that will be celebrated this year April 3-9.<br><br><strong>Health Science Center Activities in Observance of National Public Health Week</strong><br><br> <strong>April 8</strong>‰ÛÓStudents from JP Elder Middle School will have essays and posters displayed at the 13th annual Research Appreciation Day, which will take place at the Center for BioHealth.

His natural curiosity seemed to grow out of a need to know why things circulated the way they did.<br /><br />             In his youth, it was the circulation of fish in a pond that fascinated Farias. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;d go fishing, I&rsquo;d make a mark with the hook on the fish to see if I could catch it again. I always wondered where it would be the next day,&rdquo; Farias said. &ldquo;Actually, one time I did catch the same fish about a month later.&rdquo;<br /><br />             That affinity toward circulation grew as he matured, and Farias himself circulated. Born in Brownsville, Farias moved to San Antonio for his undergraduate education, earning a bachelor of arts degree in biology from Our Lady of the Lake University.<br /><br />             &ldquo;I went there because it was a small campus,&rdquo; Farias said. &ldquo;You get one-on-one contact with the professors.&rdquo;<br /><br />             From San Antonio, Farias made his way back to the University of Texas at Brownsville and a cooperative training program between the University of Texas at Brownsville and the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.<br /><br />             It was during his years at the health science center that Farias&rsquo; abiding interest in circulation became a passion. Now what fascinates Farias is circulation of a different type&mdash;coronary circulation.<br /><br />                        His research at the health science center resulted in publications in the <em>American Journal of Physiology </em>and his PhD in physiology. Farias also earned a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Washington&rsquo;s Department of Physiology, where he has continued his research on coronary circulation, resulting in several other publications.<br /><br />             In addition to his natural curiosity, what has driven Farias is his dedication to educational access and opportunities for minority students. For these efforts, Farias was named a Minority Access National Alumnus Role Model Award winner at the Role Models Award Banquet in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />             &ldquo;Dr. Farias symbolizes Minority Access&rsquo; ideal alumnus role model&mdash;one who has made significant contributions to biomedical research and can be viewed as a role model to minority students,&rdquo; said Andrea Mickle, president and chief executive officer of Minority Access Inc.<br /><br />             Minority Access Inc. is a non-profit educational organization that supports individuals; institutions; federal, state and local governmental agencies; and various corporations to diversify campuses and work sites by improving the recruitment, retention and enhancement of minorities.<br /><br />  The Role Models&rsquo; Conference was created from a cooperative agreement between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; National Institutes of Health and Minority Access Inc. to focus national attention on people who have excelled in producing and supporting minority researchers, particularly in the biomedical sciences and health-related fields.<br /><br /> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really honored to receive this award,&rdquo; Farias said. &ldquo;My goal is to become a professor and perform cardiovascular research. I also think it is important to create more opportunities of access for minorities.&rdquo;<br /><br /> Robert Kaman, JD, PhD, associate dean and director of outreach for the health science center, praised Farias&rsquo; dedication to giving back to minority students. Kaman was instrumental in recruiting Farias into the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Bridges to the Doctorate Degree program.<br /><br />  &ldquo;Martin Farias continues to be a fine example of the American Dream in education--where hard work and dedication allow young men and women from all backgrounds to achieve the highest level of scholarship that our society has to offer,&rdquo; Kaman said. &ldquo;But Martin has gone further than just achieving his own lofty goals--from the beginning of our association he has continued to reach back, encourage and assist those students who are following him. He has raised the bar for those students in both science and society, and his success in each inspires them, as well as those faculty who have been fortunate enough to know him.&rdquo;<br /><br /> Farias, his wife Valerie and their children currently live in Washington, but they will be circulating to Louisiana Sate University Health Science Center this summer for Martin&rsquo;s second post-doctoral fellowship.<br /><br />  The two met at the Founders&rsquo; Activity Center on the health science center campus when Valerie was working in the pediatrics department. Valerie is from Saginaw, and her parents, Cleto and Rosa Salazar, still live in Saginaw, so a return to the area might be in the future for the Fariases and a position at the health science center is not out of the question.<br /><br /> &ldquo;That would be nice, to come back,&rdquo; Farias said.<br /><br /> ###<br /><br /> <strong>Contact:</strong> Kay Colley 817-735-2553, cell 817-980-5090, e-mail <a href=""mailto:"">kacolley@hsc.unt.edu</a>.",,,,,288,2/16/05 0:00,UNTHSC FOUNDATION NAMES NEW BOARD MEMBERS FOR 2005,"The University of North Texas Health Science Center Foundation has named four community leaders to serve on its Board of Directors for 2005.<br><br>             The foundation supports the health science center‰Ûªs colleges--the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, the School of Health Professions and the School of Public Health.<br><br>The new board members are:-Richard Connor, who is editor, publisher and owner of the Fort Worth Business Press.

Double blind means that the institution and the researcher were unidentified in the competition.<br><br>The study is designed to determine whether the replacement of the annexin II gene, using nanoparticle technology, results in the regression of breast cancer. Annexin II is a protein that affects formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Tumor growth is dependent on new blood vessel formation. Dr. Vishwanatha's research uses a novel nanotechnology-based gene delivery method to inhibit the angiogenesis process as a way to treat breast cancer.<br><br>Nanoparticles eliminate the problems of toxicity and immunogenicity associated with other gene therapy delivery methods because they are biologically compatible. This compatibility means there are fewer incidents of side effects caused by the therapy itself. Nanoparticles also provide sustained gene expression, eliminating the need for frequent injection of the gene therapy.<br><br>###<br><br><strong>Contact:</strong> Kay Colley 817-735-2553, cell 817-980-5090, e-mail <a href=""mailto:"">kacolley@hsc.unt.edu </a> ",,,,,267,1/4/05 0:00,RUDICK RETIRES FROM UNTHSC,"Victoria Rudick, PhD, retired from the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth after serving as associate dean of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences since 2000.

The approval came in a special teleconference meeting at 9:30 a.m. <br><br>The Texas Independent Osteopathic Physicians Association is a nonprofit physician organization certified by the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners. TIOPA, Inc., serves as a managed care credentialing and contracting organization for approximately 310 North Texas physicians and 80 UNTHSC physicians.

The Health Science Center stepped in to offer interim management services for TIOPA to ensure business continuity for its faculty physicians and many of its local referring physicians.<br><br>The proposal to transfer TIOPA administration to the Health Science Center was made so UNTHSC physicians would still have access to managed care credentialing and contracting. If the board of regents had failed to approve the proposal, the Health Science Center‰Ûªs faculty practice plan would have had to renegotiate many of the university‰Ûªs third-party payer contracts, causing a disruption in payments. <br><br>‰ÛÏRoughly one-third of practice plan revenue for fiscal year 2003-04 was derived from contracts negotiated and administered by TIOPA, Inc.; therefore, any disruption in these payments would have impacted our clinical operations,‰Ûù said Marc B.

Enrollment numbers at all three campuses are at all-time highs. <br><br>All enrollment statistics are unofficial until they are verified by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board later in the fall. <br><br>###<br><br><strong>Contact:</strong> Kay Colley, 817-735-2553, 817-980-5090 (cell)",,,,,
